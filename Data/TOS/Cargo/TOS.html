     Terms of Service
    </h1>
    <br>
    <p>
     <b>
      WARNING:
     </b>
     Cargo is currently in development. You understand and agree that the Service may still contain software bugs, suffer disruptions and not operate as intended or designated. Your use of the Service at this stage signifies your understanding of and agreement to participate in the Service's development.
    </p>
    <b>
     1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
    </b>
    <p>
     Welcome to Cargo's personal publishing platform (the  "Service"). Your use of the Service is subject to these Terms of Service ("TOS"). Cargo reserves the right to update and change the TOS from time to time without notice or acceptance by you. The TOS will also be applicable to the use of the Service on a trial basis. By using the Service, you signify your irrevocable acceptance of this TOS.
    </p>
    <b>
     2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE
    </b>
    <p>
     The Service is web-based and allows users that register for an account on the Service (an "Account Holder") to create and update an online web site on Cargocollective.com. Once registered with the Service, each Account Holder receives his or her own Web Site to post "Content" (as such term is defined in Section 7). Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new Cargo tools and resources, shall be subject to the TOS. In order to use the Service, you must obtain access to the World Wide Web, either directly or through devices that access web-based content, and pay any service fees associated with such access. In addition, you must provide all equipment necessary to make such connection to the World Wide Web, including a computer and modem or other access device. You also understand and agree that the service may include certain communications from Cargo, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the Cargo Newsletter, and that these communications are considered part of Cargo membership and you will be able to opt out of receiving them. You agree not to access the Service by any means other than through the interfaces that are provided by Cargo for use in accessing the Service.
    </p>
    <b>
     3. REGISTRATION
    </b>
    <p>
     In order to use the Service, you must have a valid Cargo ID. To be an Account Holder with your own web site, you must provide Cargo with a valid email address and other information ("Registration Data"). As an Account Holder, you will choose a password and account designation for your web sites during the Service's registration process. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to (a) immediately notify Cargo in writing of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. Cargo cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this Section 3. In consideration of use of the Service, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form, and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Cargo has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Cargo has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof). Users under 13 years of age are prohibited from using the Service.
    </p>
    <b>
     4. CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION
    </b>
    <p>
     If you cancel the Service, your cancellation will take effect immediately. After cancellation, you will no longer have access to your Web site and all information contained therein may be deleted by Cargo. Cargo accepts no liability for such deleted information or content.
     <br>
     <br>
     You agree Cargo, in its sole discretion, may terminate your password, and/or account, and remove and discard any Content within the Service (including, but not limited to your web site if you are an Account Holder), for any reason, including and without limitation, the lack of use, or if Cargo believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of the TOS. Any contracts, verbal or written or assumed, in conjunction with your deleted web site (as applicable) and all its parts, at Cargo's discretion, will be terminated as well. Cargo may also in its sole discretion and at any time, discontinue providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Service under any provision of this TOS may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Cargo may immediately deactivate or delete your web site, as applicable, and all related information and files. Cargo reserves the right to bar any further access to such files or the Service. You agree that Cargo shall not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your access to the Service.
    </p>
    <b>
     5. CARGO PRIVACY POLICY

You agree to immediately notify Cargo in writing of any unauthorized uses of the account or any other breaches of security. Cargo cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation. You acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances will Cargo be liable, in any way, for any acts or omissions by an Account Holder or a Guest, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.

You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or other Cargo services, third-party content or third-party software. If any provision of the TOS or incorporated documents are found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
