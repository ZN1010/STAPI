                       is to unite a global open source community to build and promote Drupal. Part of our work includes maintaining and improving the infrastructure and software that fuel Drupal.org. We welcome you (the “user”, “you”) as a contributor of code, training, documentation, design, and plain old opinions to the Drupal Project. Before you create an account on this Website, however, we ask that you please read and agree to the following Terms of Service (“Terms of Service”).

                       These Terms of Service are meant to tell you about the services the Association provides through Drupal.org, and the rights and responsibilities that guide us both. Although the Association makes Drupal.org available to the community, it is the community, including you, that creates the majority of contributions to the site. Our intent is to provide a platform for the community to do its work.

                      <p>
                       The Drupal community is actively engaged in the governance and improvement of Drupal.org. This includes code contributions as well as oversight provided by members of the Drupal.org Content, Software, and Infrastructure Working Groups. As the organization with legal responsibility for Drupal.org, the Association asks that you follow the policies outlined in this Terms of Service.
                      </p>

                       5. Arbitration. All disputes (whether in contract, tort or otherwise, whether statutory, common law or equitable and whether pre-existing, present or future) against the Association, its agents, employees, affiliates, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Association Affiliates"), relating to these Terms or any aspect of the Website will be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the Arbitration Service of Portland, Inc. ("ASP") under its arbitration rules then in effect. You may obtain a copy of those rules by writing to ASP at 620 SW 5th Avenue, Suite 1010, Portland, Oregon 97204, United States of America, by downloading the rules from ASP's website,
                       <a href="http://www.arbserve.com/">
                        http://www.arbserve.com
                       </a>
                       , or by telephoning ASP at +1 503-226-3109 or +1-800-423-1216. That arbitration will be conducted before a single neutral arbitrator and will be limited solely to the dispute between the Association and you, the user. The arbitration will be conducted in Portland, Oregon, or by telephone or online. Any award of the arbitrator will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Either you or the Association may, without violating this provision, seek from a court any equitable relief that may be necessary to protect the rights or property of that person pending the appointment of an arbitrator (or pending the arbitrator's determination of the merits of the controversy), and in those cases, you irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of Oregon, you waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in those courts and any claim that forum is inconvenient, and you agree not to initiate any proceeding against the Association in any other jurisdiction.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       6. Any cause of action or claim you may have arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service or the Website must be commenced within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues, otherwise, such cause of action or claim is permanently barred.

                       7. Waiver and Severability. If in any circumstance, we do not apply or enforce any provision of these Terms of Use, it is not a waiver of that provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or the arbitrator to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect.
