In this Privacy Policy, the term "personal data" means information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person.</p>
<p>We know that you, the user of the Service, are concerned about how we use and disclose personal data.

<p>We wish to remind you that this Privacy Policy applies to personal data that we process when you use the Service. It does not apply to any links to third parties' websites and/or services that you may encounter when you use the Service (including, without limitation, any blogs which you may access when you the Service and any user feedback services that the Service may provide links to).

Therefore, please be careful when sharing personal data about you generally in the Service and with other users of the Service. If you register with the Service, you will create a publicly visible user profile under your username. The profile allows other users of the Service to see for instance your name, location, your picture/avatar and profile text (if such data is provided to us by you), blogs and users you follow in the Service and users that are following you, and the posts and other items that you “like” in the Service. Such data may be shown on your profile page, in connection with the posts you like in the Service, on the profile page for the blogs you follow and in social features of the Service. If you wish, you may flag blogs you are following as "private" on the “Manage the blogs you follow” page in the Service, in which case your profile information is removed from the blog profile and the blog is removed from your user profile. However, other items specified above will still be visible for other users of the Service.</p>
<p>The social features of the Service also allow you to follow other users and other users to follow you. Your profile will be visible on the profile page of the users who follow you, and the users following you will be able to see when you start following other users. You can also connect your user profile with a blog, if you prove that you own that blog. In this case the blogs you own and blog profile texts for such blogs, if any, will be visible to other users in connection with your profile and in blog listings.
