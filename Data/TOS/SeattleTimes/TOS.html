      31.	DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT (“DMCA”) NOTICE
     </h4>
     <p>
      In operating the Sites, we may act as a “services provider” (as defined by DMCA) and offer services as online provider of materials and links to third party web sites. As a result, third party materials that we do not own or control may be transmitted, stored, accessed or otherwise made available using the Sites. The Seattle Times has in place certain legally mandated procedures regarding allegations of copyright infringement occurring on the Website. The Seattle Times has adopted a policy that provides for the immediate removal of any content or the suspension of any user that is found to have infringed on the rights of The Seattle Times or of a third party, or that has otherwise violated any intellectual property laws or regulations, or any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you believe any material available via the Sites infringes a copyright, you should notify us using the notice procedure for claimed infringement under the DMCA (17 U.S.C. Sect. 512(c)(2)). We will respond expeditiously to remove or disable access to the material claimed to be infringing and will follow the procedures specified in the DMCA to resolve the claim between the notifying party and the alleged infringer who provided the Content. Our designated agent (i.e., proper party for notice) to whom you should address infringement notices under the DMCA is Evelyn Ringman, 1000 Denny Way, Seattle, WA 98109, 206-464-2299, eedens@seattletimes.com.
