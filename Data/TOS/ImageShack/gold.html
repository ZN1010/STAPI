<h2>THE SHORT VERSION</h2>
<p>ImageShack is here to serve all of your image hosting needs, so you can upload anything you want. However, if content you upload is subject to subpoena from local or international law enforcement, we will release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with a law. As a general rule of thumb, do not upload material that can be construed as, copyrighted material, harassment, abuse, spam or illegal. If you do, your account might be subject to ban, your images might be deleted, and you might be prevented from viewing any images hosted on the ImageShack Network. You must own the content that you upload. Do not use Free ImageShack accounts for any commercial purpose, unless otherwise authorized by Imageshack in writing. If you intend to use your ImageShack account for any sort of business application you must purchase to one of the offered Subscription plans.</p>
