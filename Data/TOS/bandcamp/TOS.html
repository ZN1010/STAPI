        <p>
         Welcome to the non-legally-binding introductory paragraph to our Terms of Use! We recognize that the following document is the literary equivalent of 20 milligrams of Ambien, but it really and truly is required that you read and agree to it before using Bandcamp. We've done our best to make it all go down smooth – you won't find any 8-point type, or long sections of TOTALLY UNREADABLE ALL-CAPS intended to fulfill the legal definition of "conspicuous" (we're pretty sure Your Honor will accept
         <span class="conspicuous">
          yellow, bold text
         </span>
         instead). Still, what follows is plenty involved, so we thought we'd kick things off by answering the top three things a visitor to this page might be wondering:
        </p>
        <ol class="traditional-list">
         <li>
          <strong>
           Am I signing over the rights to my music, home and firstborn?
          </strong>
          No. The only rights we take are the obvious ones we need to run the service. For example, the right to host the music you upload, stream and sell it on your behalf, display whatever lyrics and artwork you put on the site, and so on. The full details are

           What can I upload? Are covers OK?
          </strong>
          You must own or control all rights to everything you upload. That means covers are out, unless you have a written license or authorization from the artist to upload the cover to Bandcamp and grant us the rights in the terms below. Do not upload cover songs unless you have obtained all permissions and authorizations in writing! These requirements apply regardless of whether you're selling the music or giving it away.

        <p>
         As a condition to using certain features of the Service (including, without limitation, the free download feature, or making a purchase from Company or an Artist), you may be required to provide certain personal information to Company or relevant Artists, such as your e-mail address, country of residence and zip/postal code ("Fan Information").
        </p>
        <p>
         You may register with the Company as a fan and create a user account (“Fan Account”), which will allow you to access certain features of the Service that are only available through Fan Accounts, such as a wishlist, a fan profile page that lists your history of purchases of Music along with information that you choose to share about yourself, and the ability to follow other fans or Artists . Following an Artist or purchasing a subscription to an Artist (an “Artist Subscription”) gives that Artist access to your email address, as does making a purchase from an Artist while logged in to your Fan Account. Your wishlist, history of purchases of Music, and any information you provide for your profile page will be available to other users of the Service by default, subject to our Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
         As a condition to each such Artist’s right to receive such Fan Information, Company requires each Artist to agree to the terms set forth in the next section of this Agreement. However, you acknowledge that Company has no control over the use of the Fan Information by the Artists, and you further acknowledge and agree that Bandcamp shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the Artists’ use of such Fan Information.

         In connection with certain features of the Service, including by requiring that fans provide you with their e-mail addresses and other personal information in order to access the free download option, you may collect certain types of Fan Information. As a condition to receiving such Fan Information, you acknowledge and agree that you will not disclose, rent, or sell any Fan Information to any third party, and you will use the Fan Information only in connection with the Artist’s mailing list or Artist Subscription, in order to provide fans with general information and news about the Artist, such as upcoming shows, new Music or other Content delivered in connection with your Artist Subscription. You further agree that any e-mail or other communication sent to the Artist’s mailing list or sent in connection with the Artist Subscription will comply with e-mail marketing laws and include a mechanism by which the recipient can unsubscribe from the mailing list, along with clear instructions on how to do so (i.e. a functioning "opt-out" mechanism). You will promptly implement a recipient’s request to opt-out of receiving e-mails from you and will not send any further e-mails to such opting-out recipient.

You shall provide Company with accurate, complete, and updated registration information.  Failure to do so shall constitute a breach of these Terms of Use, which may result in immediate termination of your Company account.  You shall not (i) select or use as a User ID or domain a name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; (ii) use as a User ID or domain a name subject to any rights of a person other than you without appropriate authorization; or (iii) use as a User ID or domain a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene.

         Fees and Payments – Fans.
        </h3>
        <p>
         You may purchase products and/or services from an Artist through the Site, including, without limitation, purchases of Content (including digital Content made available via download and streaming through the Service (“Digital Content”)), physical merchandise (“Merchandise”) and Artist Subscriptions. Each such purchase is a “Transaction.”
        </p>
        <p>
         All inquiries regarding Transactions involving Merchandise only (a “Merchandise Transaction”) will be directed to the relevant Artist.  Company is not responsible for refunds for Merchandise, except as provided in this Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
         All sales of Digital Content are final (except where prohibited by law), unless otherwise determined by Bandcamp. If you do not receive the Digital Content or otherwise have an issue with the Digital Content delivered, please contact Bandcamp with your request and proof of payment, and we will notify the relevant Artist and work with them to resolve your issue. At Bandcamp’s sole discretion, you may be credited or refunded for the Digital Content. However, you understand and agree that Bandcamp is a platform that Artists use to sell their products, and the Digital Content is derived from files provided by the relevant Artist, and the relevant Artist is solely responsible for such files.
        </p>
        <p>
         Your total price for Digital Content will include the price of the product plus any applicable sales tax; such sales tax is based on your location and the sales tax rate in effect at the time you purchase the product. We will charge tax only in states or countries where digital goods are taxable.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you purchase an Artist Subscription, your payment for such Artist Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Artist Subscription before the end of the current subscription period. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period.
        </p>
        <p>
         Content you purchase in a Transaction cannot be guaranteed to be available to you perpetually. For example, if we receive a notification of claimed infringement from a copyright owner or its agent with respect to specific Content, then U.S. law may require us to remove that Content from the Service and not make it available for future sale and we may also have to deny continued access to anyone who previously purchased such Content.  This means that you may lose access to purchased Content previously available to you through the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
         If we are required by law to deny access through the Service to previously purchased Content, including by removing access to Content from a user’s personal collection through any mobile application, then Company and Artists will not provide the user who purchased that Content with a refund, except as required by applicable law. Users bear all risk from the denial of access to any Content purchased through the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because there is a possibility that we may be required to deny you access to previously purchased Content, we encourage you to promptly download any Content you purchase through the Site to your own devices so that you will retain control and possession of such Content even if we are required to remove the Content from the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
         You warrant that if you enter into a Transaction, then you shall be able to make full and immediate payment for the requested products or services.

         Fees and Payments – Artists.
        </h3>
        <p>
         You will set the prices for your products and services that are charged through Transactions (the “Prices”) through the Site, and you may change the Prices at your sole discretion. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Bandcamp may redistribute previously purchased copies of your products to users who have, in Bandcamp’s sole determination, received a corrupted copy of your product, an incorrect file format version of your product, an incomplete copy of your product, or suffered a loss of your product through hard drive failure, damage, theft or destruction, on a no-fee basis to the user (i.e., the user is not charged a new fee for the redistribution). Such redistribution may be effectuated by allowing a user to redownload a replacement copy themselves. A user that has a Fan Account will also be permitted to redownload any previously purchased Content from  an Artist. In the event of any of the foregoing redistributions, no additional payments shall be made to you for such redistributions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Company shall be entitled to a share of the revenue you receive from Transactions (the “Revenue Share”), which shall be calculated on your gross revenue from Transactions, not including any Transactions for which you or we provide a refund, in accordance with the rate schedule set forth at
         <a href="file:///C:/UsablePrivacyPolicy/Data/TOS_Corpus/TOSRandomCorpus-master/TOSRandomCorpus-master/html/pricing">
          www.bandcamp.com/pricing

         . You shall be solely responsible and liable for, and Company shall have no responsibility or liability for, any Stripe fees (except for fees charged on Company’s Stripe account), PayPal fees (except for fees charged on Company’s PayPal account), credit card transaction fees (together, “Fees”), bad debts (such as credit card returns or fraud), disputed payments, and refunds, except as provided in this Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
         Bandcamp may withhold any taxes, duties, charges or levies on payments by Bandcamp to you pursuant to this Agreement as may be required by applicable law, rule or regulation. Bandcamp shall remit any such withheld taxes, duties, charges or levies to the appropriate tax authority.
        </p>
        <p>
         For Merchandise Transactions, payments received from users for Merchandise shall be directed to you, unless there is an outstanding Revenue Share owed to Company in which case such payments may be directed to Company in accordance with Company’s standard policies. Bandcamp may retain funds otherwise payable to you if Bandcamp is required or chooses to provide a refund on your behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
         For Digital Content, Bandcamp will collect the purchase price and any applicable Fees and taxes. Bandcamp will pay you the gross proceeds we receive from the sale of Digital Content, minus the applicable Revenue Share and any applicable Fees (the “Artist Payout”).
        </p>
        <p>
         For Artist Subscriptions, payments received from users shall be directed to you (the “Subscription Fee”), minus the applicable Revenue Share and any applicable fees which shall be directed to Bandcamp at the time of each payment.
        </p>
        <p>
         When you receive a payment for Digital Content or Artist Subscription, you are liable to Bandcamp for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any Fees if the payment is later invalidated for any reason. This means that, in addition to any other liability, you will be responsible for the amount of the payment sent by the sender, plus the applicable Fees if there is a chargeback, a dispute, or if there is a reversal of the payment. You agree to allow Bandcamp to recover any amounts due to Bandcamp by debiting your account or withholding any Artist Payout or Subscription Fee. If there are insufficient funds to cover your liability, you agree to reimburse Bandcamp through other means.
        </p>
        <p>
         Company retains the right, but does not have the obligation, to immediately halt the offering or sale of any goods or services, prevent or restrict access to the Site or the Services or take any other action in case of technical problems, objectionable material, inaccurate listings, or actions otherwise prohibited by the procedures and guidelines contained on the Site, or for any other reason in the sole and absolute discretion of Company, and to correct any inaccurate listing or technical problems on the Site. Company may immediately halt the offering or sale of any goods or services upon receipt of notifications of claimed infringement, upon acquiring knowledge of actual infringement, or becoming aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing material is apparent with respect to any goods or services.

Company reserves the right to change its price list and to institute new charges at any time, upon ten (10) days prior notice to you, which may be sent by e-mail or posted on the Site.

         Because Company is not the buyer or seller in any Merchandise Transaction, if a dispute arises between one or more participants in a Merchandise Transaction, then you release Company (and its affiliates, agents and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California resident, then you waive California civil code §1542, which says: "a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."
