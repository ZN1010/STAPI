     <h2>
      The Services

     </p>
     <p>
      Additionally, your use of certain Services and Content may also be subject to disclaimers, legal notices, terms or other legal agreements (collectively, "Additional Terms"). These Additional Terms may be posted on the Site or sections of the Site where applicable. These Terms and, where applicable, the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and us regarding your access and use of the Site, Services and any Content. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between these Terms and any such Additional Terms, the Additional Terms shall control. The Services are provided for your convenience only, without any obligation by Conduit to provide any technical support or any other type of assistance.
