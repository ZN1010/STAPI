<p>Welcome to Boing Boing, a Website created by Happy Mutants, LLC, (“Happy Mutants,” “We,” “Us”) which lives at boingboing.net (“Boing Boing,” “Website,” “Site”). This Terms of Service (“Terms”), which incorporates our Privacy Policy ,  is a contract between Us and you that articulates your rights and our rights relating to the Site.</p>
<p>Don’t stop reading, please. These rules are important! By using the Site, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms. You should know what they say, especially because if you do not agree to these Terms, you should not use the Site.</p>
<h2>FOR THOSE ASKING, “WHAT IS BOING BOING?”</h2>
<p>BoingBoing.net is a Website devoted to technology and culture. We publish feature articles, links to things we find interesting online, podcasts, videos and comics created by the Boing Boing editorial team and other invited contributors. We also provide a discussion forum so you can participate in the conversation; and sell merchandise in the Boing Boing Shop.</p>
<h2>AND NOW FOR THE LEGALESE</h2>
<p>Happy Mutants grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use Boing Boing in the manner described herein.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: This means that you can read, listen to, watch, and intellectually consume everything on the Site, plus participate in our Forums. In exchange, we ask that you use the Site in the manner and spirit for which it was created and that you adhere to the policies that govern the Site’s use.</p>
<p>So in case it is unclear, you are NOT permitted to interrupt the serving of our Site, introduce malicious code to our forum, assist anyone in misusing the Site in any way, or use the Site to violate the law or the safety or dignity of another person in any way. It takes a lot of work to make this site run. Be cool.</p>
<h2>ACCOUNT CREATION</h2>
<p>You can browse the Site without logging in. However, to participate in our Discussion Forum, you need to create an account. We use the Discourse.org forum platform and the creators CDCK host it on their servers and run it for us.</p>
<p>To participate in the forum, you may create a new account, use an existing Discourse.org user name and password or log-in using one of your social networking user name and passwords. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information. You are solely responsible for all activity that occurs with your account, regardless of whether you have authorized such activities. If the security of your account has been compromised, contact CDCK immediately at privacy@cdck.org.</p>
<h2>THIS IS OUR HOUSE</h2>
<p>We may, in our sole discretion and without any forewarning, suspend or terminate your account for violating these Terms, or for any other reason we choose. We can remove your User Content without any forewarning, for any reason we choose. And even when we don’t terminate you or remove your stuff, we want to be clear that it does not imply that we assume any responsibility for, or endorse your User Content.</p>
<p>We can also remove the content we post on our site, without any forewarning, for any reason we choose.</p>
<h2>RATED PG-13</h2>
<p>We have kids. We love kids.  Really we do. But the United States government has put limits on our ability to accept users under a certain age through the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 . So to be clear, Boing Boing is not intended for users under the age of 13. Nobody under 13 may create an account or use any part of the Site that requires the submission of personally identifiable information, like email or name. Any account that is created by a person under 13 will be terminated and any content created will be removed from the Site.</p>
<h2>CC: NON-COMMERCIAL SHARING WITH ATTRIBUTION</h2>
<p>Except where indicated, Boing Boing editorial-created content is licensed under a Creative Commons License permitting non-commercial sharing with attribution . This means that you may link to it and otherwise share it, but if you do, you need to give us credit. You may not use our editorial-created content in any commercial capacity; we do this for a living. But if you have an idea for collaboration, it never hurts to ask us nicely .</p>
<h2>YOU ASSERT THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO PUBLISH WHAT YOU POST</h2>
