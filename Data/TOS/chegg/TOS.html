           In creating study related content, students must respect any intellectual property rights that others may have in content. All content posted on the
	Services must be independently created, transformative and non-derivative. It should not be a transcript or recording of another's independent efforts, nor
	should it copy from materials purchased from or created by others. It should go beyond simply summarizing material covered in class or in written or
	recorded materials, but include information raised by students in or outside of class, and independent thought, analysis and commentary. Class notes, for
	example, must be substantially rewritten after class and include independent thought and analysis, research and information; notes that use a lecturer's

           Schools may have their own policies that place restrictions on a student's ability to make commercial use of study materials, even otherwise lawful
	materials that the student has independently created. You are responsible for becoming familiar with such policies and abiding by them, and discontinuing
	the use of any Services if such use is contrary to your school policy or the instruction of your professor.

           Class notes and study guides are solely for the specific use of students in the designated class for which they are created. Individuals who are not
	registered for a class may not purchase study guides, class notes or outlines for that class. Check the accuracy of all information from study guides,
	class notes, answers and outlines – to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, Chegg does not guarantee their accuracy or completeness, they are simply an aid to the study process.

           Chegg's site may help students identify potential careers by providing a basic description for a variety of potential jobs.  In some cases, Chegg may provide salary ranges for jobs, and point users to potential job opportunities in that field, based upon your interests and skills that you have represented to Chegg that you possess.  Chegg may also help identify skills that are commonly required for those jobs, and recommend learning materials that (combined with your own efforts) may help you achieve better proficiency with those skills.  Chegg's attempts to assess your skills, identify gaps, and match those gaps to available learning materials may not be accurate in your particular circumstances.  Chegg is simply one starting point, not an exhaustive list of all potential jobs or opportunities that might be available to you, and in a fast changing employment landscape Chegg does not guarantee that the descriptions, salaries and job opportunities set out on our site are always up to date, reflect the current job market, or are applicable to the market in your area.  We believe that the materials on our site, if you use them and apply yourself, can improve your skills and employability. Still,  Chegg does not provide in depth, individualize job counseling, and your success in landing a job in a particular career depends on a wide variety of factors.  Our system's efforts to identify skills gaps, and recommend learning materials to address those gaps, may not result in improved employment prospects; completing recommended classes is in not a guarantee of finding employment in that field, or any other field.

           Chegg may also help students or alumni find internships or entry level jobs or other positions by accepting postings of job descriptions from third party employers, through its Internships.com website or other Chegg Websites.  Chegg does not confirm the accuracy of the postings, nor can Chegg know whether a particular position has been filled.  Chegg may recommend particular job postings to particular users based upon available data about the position or the user, or other criteria, but the actual criteria for job positions lie within the discretion of the employer and Chegg makes no representations about the suitability of any candidate for any listed position.

If you do not provide Chegg with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth with respect to individual actions in small claims courts.

           Further,
	unless both you and Chegg otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of
	any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Legal Disputes" section will be deemed

	the sale or purchase (buyback) of books. If a title does not have a publisher's suggested list price, the Services may not show a list price in the online

	other reason, Chegg shall have the right to refuse or cancel any order (to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law), whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit or debit card charged.
	If your credit or debit card has already been charged and your order is canceled, Chegg will issue a credit to your credit or debit card account.

           From time to time, Chegg may offer discounts, bonuses, coupons, loyalty programs, points programs, sweepstakes, contests or other promotional
	incentives. These incentives typically have their own specific rules, restrictions and limitations (e.g., limiting when, how often, and under what
	circumstances you may be eligible for the promotion). You are responsible for carefully reviewing and complying with these applicable rules, restrictions
	and limitations. You agree not to engage in any self-dealing, collusion,
	smurfing (defined as breaking large orders or sales transactions into multiple individual transactions for the purpose of obtaining multiple discounts or
	payments), or otherwise gaming or defrauding the system. By participating in such promotions, you agree to be bound by the applicable rules and
	restrictions, and that Chegg, in its sole discretion, may deny payment or benefits to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law (e.g., when it believes improper activity has occurred or when a code
	has expired). All promotions may expire at any time without notice to recipients. Discounts apply only toward the actual base product/service rental or
	purchase cost; they do not apply to taxes, shipping, extension or late fees, or any other additional fees (e.g., conversion to purchase fees).

           Unless otherwise stated in these Terms of Use, if any provision of the Terms of Use is declared invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all remaining provisions
	continue in full force and effect. The failure of Chegg to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Use is not a waiver of such right or
	provision. The section titles of the Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Non-performance of either party, except
	for the failure to make required payments, will be excused to the extent performance is delayed or rendered impossible by any reason where failure to
	perform is beyond the reasonable control of the non-performing party. This "Miscellaneous" section shall survive any expiration or termination of your

           Chegg may modify the Terms of Use including the linked policies contained herein from time to time (“Updated Terms”). You agree that we may notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Chegg Website so that they are accessible via a link on the home page, and that your use of our Services after we
	have posted the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify), you agree to be bound by the then-current version of the Terms of
	Use, including any changes we may have made since the last time you used our Services. It is therefore important that you review the Terms of Use regularly
	to ensure you are aware of any such changes. The updated Terms of Use will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified
	in the updated Terms of Use, and will apply to your use of the Services from that point forward.

           The then-current Terms of Use, including (a) any related policies and terms referenced in the Terms of Use and (b) any Additional Terms, are the

	of Chegg, and will supersede and prevail over any terms or conditions you may include with any purchase order or other transaction document or
	communication with us, regardless of whether Chegg signs them or fails to object to them. This "Entire Agreement" section shall survive any expiration or
