<div id="main"><h2>is.gd Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>
<p>We've tried to make our terms as clear and easy to read as possible, so don't expect pages of legalese!</p>
<h4>Forbidden activities</h4>
<p>is.gd may <b>NOT</b> be used creating shortened URLs that: -</p>
<ul>
<li>Are used in commercial email</li>
<li>Are used for unsolicited advertising (spam) including email, forum 
posts, SMS messages and spam posts/messaging on social networks such as 
Facebook or Twitter</li>
<li>Link to malicious content (phishing, viruses, trojans, adware, any other malware)</li>
<li>Link to any form of child pornography</li>
<li>Link to other URL shortening or redirection sites or scripts (these "chains" of links are often used to hide malicious usage)</li>
<li>Link to material that infringes copyright</li>
<li>Link to material we consider unethical including but not limited to 
"get rich quick" schemes, pyramid schemes, paid "self help" schemes, 
dubious competitions, sites requiring users to fill out paid surveys and
 sites with a model that encourges users to spam others (e.g. "Sign up 
10 members to get X free")</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition any use of is.gd and any content linked to must be legal in the UK (where is.gd is hosted).</p>
<h4>URL rejection and removal</h4>
<p>We can reject URLs when they are submitted or later remove, disable 
or redirect shortened URLs for any reason. Our intention is only to do 
this where they violate our terms or the spirit of fair usage, or we 
have reason to suspect they do (e.g. if they appear on a blacklist we 
consult). We're only human and mistakes are occasionally made - we can 
reinstate disabled shortened URLs if we think it's appropriate to do so.</p>
<h4>Excessive usage</h4>
<p>We need to keep is.gd fast and responsive for everyone so we limit 
the amount it can be used to levels we consider reasonable. See our <a href="https://is.gd/usagelimits.php">usage limits page</a>
 for the current limits. Users may not open more than 5 concurrent 
connections to is.gd at any time. For automated scripts or programs 
using our API a specific code is returned for excessive use (see our <a href="https://is.gd/developers.php">developer documentation</a>)
 and your application should wait before retrying your request. If it 
doesn't do this and continues to hammer you may get blocked.</p>
<h4>Our shortened URLs</h4>
<p>Users who create is.gd shortened URLs cannot later delete them or 
modify their destinations (this helps to prevent abuse). Our shortened 
URLs could redirect anywhere, you follow them at your own risk and is.gd
 is not responsible or liable for content you visit.</p>
<h4>Data usage</h4>
<p>We do not share any information with third parties unless explicitly stated in our <a href="https://is.gd/privacy.php">privacy policy</a>.
 We do not collect or store any information other that required to 
provide you with the service and to provide us with site usage 
statistics.</p>
<h4>Warranty and liability</h4>
<p>The short version: is.gd is free. We'll do our best to maintain it 
but we might have problems or things might break. If they do, we don't 
owe you anything.</p>
<p>The long version: we provide is.gd as a free service - as such it 
carries no warranty of any kind. is.gd and its staff and owners are not 
liable for any loss or problem you might suffer due to using the 
service. This includes losses in the event that the service stops 
operating, is unavailable or slow, suffers data loss, or any other issue
 which might be considered detrimental to you.</p>
<h4>Violation of our terms</h4>
<p>If you violate our terms, depending on the severity of the abuse, we 
may disable shortened URLs you have created or block you from using 
is.gd (and our other URL shorteners) temporarily or permanently. In 
cases of severe abuse or illegal usage we may report this to the 
relevant law enforcement agencies.</p>
