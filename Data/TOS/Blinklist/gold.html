BlinkList allows for the posting of links to third-party websites. The linked websites’ content, business practices and privacy policies are not under the control of BlinkList, and BlinkList is not responsible for the content of any linked website or any link contained in a linked website.

You agree that your only recourse is to stop using BlinkList. You understand that the creation of bookmarks in BlinkList for purposes of specifically boosting exposure of a site in BlinkList and/or search engines is a breach of these BlinkList Terms, that BlinkList views such entries as spam and that BlinkList reserves the right to take appropriate action to restrict such entries up to and including termination of your access to BlinkList.</p>

<p>By posting content, you are granting permission to BlinkList and others to access and use it in connection with BlinkList and otherwise in connection with its affiliates’ businesses.</p>

Your use of a license in connection with your content does not affect BlinkList' right to access and use it in connection with BlinkList or otherwise in connection with its affiliates’ businesses.</p>
<p>BlinkList does not provide legal services, and therefore, providing you with the ability to attach a license agreement to your compilation of links does not create an attorney-client relationship. The license agreements and all related information are provided on an "as is" basis. BlinkList makes no warranties whatsoever regarding the license agreements and the information provided, and disclaims all liability for damages, including without limitation, any general, special, incidental or consequential damages, resulting from their use.</p>
<p>BlinkList is explicitly not responsible for the manner or circumstances by which third parties access or use public content and is under no obligation to disable or otherwise restrict this access.

This ability does not extend to copies that others may have made or to copies that BlinkList may have made for backup purposes.</p>
<h2>4. Feeds and API</h2>
<p>BlinkList provides access to portions of BlinkList via RSS feeds and an API; for the purposes of these BlinkList Terms, such access constitutes use of BlinkList. BlinkList asks that you use these features respectfully, as outlined in the documentation. You may not use these or any other features or BlinkList itself to allow the display of a substantial portion of the BlinkList database or reproduce, duplicate or copy BlinkList. BlinkList reserves the right to change these features at any time and to disable access to the feeds and the API at any time for any reason.</p>
