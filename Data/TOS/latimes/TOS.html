&nbsp;
<a href="http://tronc.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" title="Privacy Policy and Your Privacy Rights">Privacy Policy</a>,
 whether or not you registered with the Site. All references to “you” or
 “your,” as applicable, mean the person who accesses, uses, and/or 
participates in the Site in any manner, and each of your heirs, assigns,
 and successors. The Site reserves the right to deny access to any 
person who violates these Terms.</p>

<p><b>Eligibility</b>. The Site is intended solely for persons who are 
13 or older. Any access to or use of the Site by anyone under 13 is 
expressly prohibited. By accessing or using the Site you represent and 
warrant that you are 13 or older.</p>

<p><b>Copyright.</b>
&nbsp;All information, content, services and software displayed on, 
transmitted through, or used in connection with the Site (with the 
exception of User Content as defined below), including, for example, 
news articles, stories, reviews, directories, guides, text, photographs,
 images, illustrations, audio clips, video, html, source and object 
code, trademarks, logos, and the like (collectively, the "Content"), as 
well as its selection and arrangement, is owned by tronc and/or its 
licensors and suppliers. You may use the Content online only, and solely
 for your personal, non-commercial use, and you may download or print a 
single copy of any portion of the Content solely for your personal, 
non-commercial use, provided you do not remove any trademark, copyright 
or other notice from such Content. If you operate a Web site and wish to
 link to the Site, you may do so provided you agree to cease such link 
upon request from us. No other use is permitted without prior written 
permission of tronc. The permitted use described in this section is 
contingent on your compliance at all times with these Terms.</p>

<p>Except where explicitly provided for herein or on the Site, you may 
not republish any portion of the Content on any Internet, Intranet, 
extranet site or any other online or offline publication, or incorporate
 the Content in any database, compilation, archive, cache, or similar 
medium. You may not distribute any Content to others, whether or not for
 payment or other consideration, and you may not archive, modify, copy, 
frame, cache, reproduce, sell, publish, transmit, display or otherwise 
use any portion of the Content. You may not scrape or otherwise copy our
 Content without our permission. You agree not to decompile, reverse 
engineer or disassemble any software or other products or processes 
accessible through the Site nor to insert any code or product or 
manipulate the Content or the Site in any way, and not to use any data 
mining, data gathering or extraction method.</p>

<p><b>Requests to use Content for any purpose other than as permitted in these Terms should be </b><b>directed to </b>
<a href="mailto:termsofservice@tronc.com">termsofservice@tronc.com</a><b>.</b><b>
&nbsp;</b>In certain cases, you may be able to use individual stories, 
articles, or video that appear on the Site through online functionality 
we have specifically designated (e.g., to e-mail a story to a friend or 
to purchase the rights to reproduce a story for other use). In such 
cases, we will tell you directly in the portion of the Content you may 
use or you will see a link in the Content itself that will permit you to
 email the story, article, or video, or purchase the rights to reproduce
 it.</p>

<p><b>Registration</b>. Registration is not required to view certain 
Content. However, to use some parts of the Site --- including without 
limitation, if you wish to post a comment or upload a photo or video, or
 view certain other Content --- you may be required to register or 
subscribe and provide certain information about yourself. If you become a
 registered member of the Site, you accept responsibility for all 
activities that occur under your registration account. You agree to 
provide true, accurate, complete, and correct information at the time of
 registration, and to promptly update this information as needed so that
 it remains true, accurate, complete, and correct. We reserve the right 
to terminate your access and use of the Site if individuals from more 
than one household access the Site using any single registration 
account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
 password and for restricting access to your computer so others outside 
your household may not access the Site using your name in whole or in 
part without your permission. If you believe someone has accessed the 
Site using your registration account and password without your 
authorization, e-mail us immediately at
<a href="mailto:termsofservice@tronc.com">termsofservice@tronc.com</a>.</p>

<p><b>User Content Representations and Warranties.</b>
&nbsp;By placing material on the Site, including but not limited to 
posting content or communications to any Site bulletin board, forum, 
blogspace, message or chat area, or posting text, images, audio files, 
video clips, or any &nbsp;audio-visual content to the Site 
(collectively, "User Content"), you represent and warrant: (1) you own 
or otherwise have all necessary rights to the User Content you provide 
and the rights to provide it under these Terms; and (2) the User Content
 will not cause injury to any person or entity. Using a name other than 
your own legal name in association with the submission of User Content 
is prohibited (except in those specific areas of the Site that may 
specifically ask for unique, fictitious names).</p>

<p><b>User Content License.</b>
&nbsp;For all User Content you post, upload, or otherwise make available
 (in this section - "Provide") to the Site, you grant tronc a worldwide,
 royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and fully 
sub-licensable license to use, copy, reproduce, distribute, publish, 
publicly perform, publicly display, modify, adapt, translate, archive, 
store, and create derivative works from such User Content, in whole or 
in part, in any form, format, or medium, of any kind now known or later 
developed. Without limiting the generality of the previous sentence, you
 authorize tronc to: (i) share the User Content across all websites, 
mobile applications, newspapers and other online and offline services 
affiliated with tronc; (ii) include the User Content in a searchable 
format accessible by users of the Site and other tronc websites, mobile 
applications, newspapers and other online services; (iii) place 
advertisements in close proximity to such User Content; and (iv) use 
your name, likeness and any other information in connection with our use
 of the material you Provide. You waive all moral rights with respect to
 any User Content you Provide to the Site. You also grant tronc the 
right to use any material, information, ideas, concepts, know-how or 
techniques contained in any communication you Provide or otherwise 
submit to us for any purpose whatsoever, including but not limited to, 
commercial purposes, and developing, manufacturing and marketing 
commercial products using such information. All rights in this section 
are granted without the need for additional compensation of any sort by 
tronc to you. You agree that you will indemnify, defend, and hold 
harmless tronc and its officers, directors and employees for all claims 
resulting from User Content you post. We reserve the right, at our own 
expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of such disputes, 
and in any event you will cooperate with us in asserting any available 
defenses. </p>

<p>You also hereby grant each user of the Site a non-exclusive license 
to access your User Content through the Site, and to use, reproduce, 
distribute, display and perform such User Content as permitted through 
the functionality of the Site and under these Terms. </p>

<p><b>Unsolicited Material and Ideas.</b>
&nbsp;We are happy to hear from our users and welcome feedback regarding
 our Site. The Site is not responsible for the similarity of any of its 
content or programming in any media to materials or ideas provided to 
the Site. If you do transmit unsolicited submissions to us through the 
Site or otherwise, you grant tronc a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual,
 irrevocable, non-exclusive right and fully sub-licensable license to 
use, copy, reproduce, distribute, publish, publicly perform, publicly 
display, modify, adapt, translate, archive, store, and create derivative
 works from such submissions, and you understand and agree that such 
submissions may be adapted, broadcast, changed, copied, disclosed, 
licensed, performed, posted, published, sold, transmitted, or otherwise 
used as tronc sees fit. By using the Site and transmitting an 
unsolicited submission to us, you agree that you are not entitled to any
 compensation, credit or notice whatsoever with respect to such 
submission, and that by sending an unsolicited submission you waive the 
right to make any claim against the Site, tronc and its parents, 
officers or directors relating to our use of such submission, including,
 without limitation, infringement of proprietary rights, unfair 
competition, breach of implied contract or breach of confidentiality, 
even if material or an idea is used that is or may be substantially 
similar to the idea you sent.</p>

<p><b>User Content Screening and Removal.</b>
&nbsp;You acknowledge that the Site and/or its designees may or may not 
pre-screen User Content, and shall have the right (but not the 
obligation), in their sole discretion, to move, remove, block, edit, or 
refuse any User Content for any reason, including without limitation 
that such User Content violates these Terms or is otherwise 
objectionable.</p>

<p><b>User Content Assumption of Risk.</b>
&nbsp;Although the Site may from time to time monitor or review 
postings, transmissions, and the like on the Site, it cannot and does 
not monitor or manage all User Content, and does not guarantee the 
accuracy, integrity, or quality of User Content. All User Content 
provided to the Site is the sole responsibility of the person who 
provided it.
&nbsp;<b>This means that you are entirely responsible for all User Content that you provide.</b>
&nbsp;To protect your safety, please use your best judgment when using 
Site forums, chat rooms, bulletin boards, blogs or similar features. We 
discourage divulging personal phone numbers and addresses or other 
information that can be used to identify or locate you. You acknowledge 
and agree that if you make such disclosures either through posting on 
any bulletin board, forum, blogspace, message or chat area, or uploading
 text, images, audio files or other audio-visual content, in classified 
advertising you place or in other interactive areas, or to third parties
 in any communication, you do so fully understanding that such 
information could be used to identify you.</p>

<p><b>User Content Posting Rules.</b>
&nbsp;Any decisions as to whether User Content violates any posting rule
 set forth in these Terms will be made by us in our sole discretion and 
after we have actual notice of such posting. When you provide User

<p><b>WARNING: A VIOLATION OF THESE POSTING RULES MAY BE REFERRED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.</b></p>

<p>You shall notify us immediately upon becoming aware of the commission
 by any person of any restricted uses of the Site by sending an email to
<a href="mailto:termsofservice@tronc.com">termsofservice@tronc.com</a>, 
and you shall provide us with reasonable assistance in any 
investigations we conduct in light of the information you provide in 
this respect.</p>

<p>You acknowledge that we have no obligation to monitor any users’ 
access to or use of the Site, or to review or edit any Content, but we 
have the right to do so in our sole discretion: (i) for the purpose of 
operating and improving the Site (including without limitation for fraud
 prevention, risk assessment, investigation and customer support 
purposes); (ii) to ensure your compliance with these Terms; (iii) to 
comply with applicable law or the order or requirement of a court, 
administrative agency or other governmental body; or (iv) to address 
&nbsp;content that we determine is otherwise objectionable or violates 
these Terms. We reserve the right, at any time and without prior notice,
 to remove or disable access to any Content that we, in our sole 
discretion, consider to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of
 these Terms, otherwise harmful to the Site, or for any other reason 
that we deem appropriate. In order to protect the integrity of the Site,
 we also reserve the right at any time in our sole discretion to block 
users from certain IP addresses from accessing and using the Site.</p>

<p>You acknowledge, consent, and agree that we may access, preserve and 
disclose any of your information if we are required to do so by law, or 
if we believe in good faith that it is reasonably necessary: (i) to 
respond to claims asserted against us or to comply with legal process 
(for example, subpoenas, warrants, or other process ); (ii) to enforce 
or administer our agreements with users, including without limitation 
these Terms; (iii) to render services you request; (iv) to protect the 
rights or property of the Site, tronc, and their respective third-party 
suppliers and licensors; (v) for fraud prevention, risk assessment, 
investigation, customer support, product development and de-bugging 
purposes; (vi) to protect the rights, property or safety of the Site, 
its users, or members of the public; or (vii) in circumstances that we 
deem, in our sole discretion, to pose a threat to the safety of us, you 
or others.</p>

<p><b>Transactions and E-Commerce.</b>
&nbsp;During your visit to the Site, you may elect to engage in a 
transaction involving the purchase of a product such as a newspaper 
subscription, a print or online advertisement or other tangible goods 
and services. Credit card transactions and order fulfillment are often 
handled by a third-party processing agent, bank or distribution 
institution. While in most cases transactions are completed without 
difficulty, there is no such thing as perfect security on the Internet 
or offline. If you are concerned about online credit card safety, in 
most cases a telephone number will be made available so you can call us 
and place your order by phone. The Site cannot and does not take 
responsibility for the success or security of transactions undertaken or
 processed by third parties.</p>

<p><b>Linked Sites</b>
&nbsp;If we provide links to other websites, you should not infer or 
assume that we operate, control, or are otherwise connected with these 
other websites. Please be careful to read the applicable terms and 
conditions and privacy policy of any other website before you provide 
any personal information or engage in any transactions. We are not 
responsible for the content or practices of any website not part of the 
Site, even if the website is operated by a company affiliated or 
otherwise connected with us. By using the Site, you acknowledge and 
agree that we are not responsible or liable to you for any content or 
other materials hosted, served, or residing on the domain from any

<p><b id="macaw">
MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</b></p>

<p><b>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</b></p>

<p>You and tronc agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and 
that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and 
enforcement of these arbitration provisions.</p>

<p>This Section is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any 
and all disputes between us, including but not limited to claims arising
 out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, 
whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or 
any other legal theory; claims that arose before these Terms or any 
prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to 
advertising); and claims that may arise after the termination of these 
Terms.
&nbsp;<b>The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the 
litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as 
provided below.</b></p>

<p>By agreeing to these Terms, you agree to resolve any and all disputes with tronc as follows:</p>

<p><b>Initial Dispute Resolution</b><b>.</b>
&nbsp;Most disputes can be resolved without resort to litigation. You can reach our Customer Support Department at
&nbsp;
<a href="mailto:termsofservice@tronc.com">termsofservice@tronc.com</a>. 
Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the 
parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, 
question, or disagreement directly through consultation with our 
Customer Support Department, and good faith negotiations shall be a 
condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p>

<p><b>Binding Arbitration</b><b>.</b><b> </b>If the parties do not reach
 an agreed-upon solution within a period of sixty&nbsp; (60) days from 
the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial 
Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate 
binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the 
terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or 
relating to these Terms (including the Terms' or Privacy Policy's 
formation, performance, and breach), the parties' relationship with each
 other, and/or your use of the Site shall be finally settled by binding 
arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined
 Arbitration Procedure Rules for claims that do not exceed $250,000 and 
the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims 
exceeding $250,000 in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, 
excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.
 The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, 
shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or
 relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or 
formation of these Terms or the Privacy Policy, including but not 
limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms or Privacy 
Policy is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, 
or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. The arbitrator shall be
 empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under 
law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be written and shall be 
binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of 
competent jurisdiction. To start an arbitration, you must do the 
following: (a) write a Demand for Arbitration that includes a 
description of the claim and the amount of damages you seek to recover 
(you may find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at
&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/">www.jamsadr.com</a>
&nbsp;); (b) send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the 
appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San
 Francisco, California 94111; and (c) send one copy of the Demand for 
Arbitration to tronc at 435 N. Michigan Ave., ATTENTION: LEGAL, Chicago,
 IL 60611.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of 
filing a lawsuit, tronc will pay the additional cost. If the arbitrator 
finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, tronc will pay the fees 
invoiced by JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing 
expenses. You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the 
arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.</p>

<p>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration 
provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury 
trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of 
arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to 
discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>

<p>If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take 
place in the county where you reside at the time of filing. For 
individuals residing outside the United States, arbitration shall be 
initiated in Cook County in the State of Illinois, United States of 
America, and you and tronc agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction 
of any federal or state court in Cook County, Illinois in order to 
compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to 
confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the 
arbitrator.</p>

<p><b>Class Action Waiver</b><b>.</b><b> </b>The parties further agree 
that the arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities 
only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the 
parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek 
relief on a class basis.
&nbsp;<b>YOU AND tronc AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE 
OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR
 CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</b>
&nbsp;If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver
 set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or 
that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration 
provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their 
entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate
 disputes on a class basis.</p>

<p><b>Exception</b><b>.</b><i> Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims:</i>
&nbsp;Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes 
through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, 
validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, 
piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal 
court or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its 
intellectual property rights ("intellectual property rights" means 
patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but 
not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a
 small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that 
court's jurisdiction.</p>

<p><b>30-Day Right to Opt Out</b><b>.</b>
&nbsp;You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration 
and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written 
notice of your decision to opt out to
&nbsp;
<a href="mailto:termsofservice@tronc.com">termsofservice@tronc.com</a>
&nbsp;with the subject line, "MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION 
WAIVER OPT-OUT." The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of (a) 
the Effective Date of these Terms; or (b) the first date that you used 
the Site that contained any versions of the Terms that included this 
version of the mandatory arbitration and class action waiver, whichever 
is later.&nbsp; Otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in 
accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt out of these 
arbitration provisions, tronc also will not be bound by them.</p>

<p><b>Changes to This Section</b>. Any changes to this section will be 
made in the same manner as described in the Modifying these Terms 
section above; however, such changes will only become effective sixty 
(60) days after the revised Effective Date of these Terms and only will 
&nbsp;apply prospectively to claims arising after the sixtieth (60th) 
day. If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on "Changes 
to This Section" is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall
 be severed from the section entitled “Mandatory Arbitration and Class 
Action Waiver,” and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first 
Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after
 you began using the Site.</p>

<p><b>Survival</b><b>.</b> This Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of your account or the Site.</p>

<p><b>General Provisions</b></p>

<p><b>Force Majeure.</b>
&nbsp;The failure of the Site to comply with any provision of these 
Terms due to an act of God, hurricane, war, fire, riot, earthquake, 
terrorism, act of public enemies, actions of governmental authorities 
outside of the control of the Site (excepting compliance with applicable
 codes and regulations) or other force majeure event will not be 
considered a breach of these Terms.</p>

<p><b>Severability.</b>
&nbsp;If for any reason any provision of these Terms is found 
unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent 
permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties as reflected in 
that provision, and the remainder of these Terms shall continue in full 
force and effect.</p>

<p><b>No Waiver.</b>
&nbsp;Any failure of the Site to enforce or exercise any provision of 
these Terms or related right shall not constitute a waiver of that right
 or provision.</p>

<p><b>No Third-Party Beneficiaries.</b>
&nbsp;You agree, except as expressly provided in these Terms, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms.</p>

<p><b>Section Titles.</b>
&nbsp;The section titles used in these Terms are purely for convenience and carry with them no legal or contractual effect.</p>

<p><b>Termination.</b>
&nbsp;In the event of termination of these Terms for any reason, you 
agree the following provisions will survive: the provisions regarding 
limitations on your use of Content, the license(s) you have granted to 
the Site, the Disputes provisions, and all other provisions for which 
survival is equitable or appropriate.</p>

<p><b>Conflicts.</b>
&nbsp;In the case of a conflict between these Terms and the terms of any
 electronic or machine readable statement or policy, these Terms shall 
control. Similarly, in case of a conflict between these Terms and our 
Privacy Policy, these Terms control.</p>

<p><b>No Joint Venture, Partners</b><b>hip, or Agency Relationship.</b>
&nbsp;No joint venture, partnership or agency relationship exists 
between you and the Site. These Terms, our Privacy Policy, any uses of 
the Site by you, and any information, products, or services provided by 
the Site to you do not create and shall not be construed to create a 
joint venture, partnership or agency relationship between you and the 
Site or tronc.</p>

<p><b>Limitation of Liability and Disclaimer of Warranties are Material Terms of these Terms.</b>
&nbsp;You agree that the provisions of these Terms that limit liability 
and disclaim warranties are essential terms of these Terms of Service.</p>

<p><b>Entire Agreement.</b>
&nbsp;These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and the 
Site and supersede all prior or contemporaneous understandings regarding
 such subject matter. No amendment to or modification of these Terms 
will be binding unless made in writing and signed by tronc. No failure 
to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of either party, 
any right or any power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor 
shall any single or partial exercise of any right or power hereunder 
preclude further exercise of any other right hereunder. In the event of a
 conflict between these Terms and any applicable purchase or other 
terms, these Terms shall govern.
