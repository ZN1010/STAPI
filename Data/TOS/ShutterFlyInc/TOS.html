         Subscription Photobook Apps
        </h3>
        <p>
         Our mobile apps for the PrintFix and Groovebook subscription services (each a "Subscription Photobook App") offer you an opportunity to have your smartphone photos shipped to you in a 4" x 6" photo book every month. By purchasing or receiving a Subscription Photobook App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not use the Subscription Photobook App.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Subscription Photobook App, which may start with a free trial, will continue month-to month unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. Your device must be able to support the Subscription Photobook App and you must provide us with a current, valid, accepted method of payment (as such may be updated from time to time, "Payment Method") to use the Subscription Photobook App. We will bill the monthly subscription fee to your Payment Method. The monthly subscription price includes shipping and handling, but does not include any applicable taxes. We may change the price for the subscription from time to time, and will communicate any price changes to you. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. By continuing to use the Subscription Photobook App after the price change takes effect, you accept the new price. If you reside in a country that is part of the European Union and have purchased a subscription, you have the right to change your mind and receive a full refund within fourteen (14) days of purchase (the "Cooling-off Period"), but only if you have not logged in or otherwise redeemed or started to consume it. Any cancellation of your Subscription Photobook App will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period. However, if you cancel your payment and/or terminate the Terms after the Cooling-off Period is over (where applicable), and/or before the end of the subscription period, we will not refund any fees already paid to us, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.
        </p>
        <p>
         In certain jurisdictions, gift subscriptions for the Subscription Photobook App may be available for purchase, which are one time use cards and are only redeemable for the Groovebook Service in countries where the service is offered in the currency denominated on the gift subscription. Gift subscriptions are assigned a fixed monetary value (e.g., $35). The entire value of the gift subscriptions will be applied to your Subscription Photobook App account upon redemption. Gift subscriptions are not refundable (whether cash or otherwise), except to the extent required by applicable law. Gift subscriptions cannot be used to purchase other gift subscriptions, and cannot be reloaded, resold or transferred for value. Gift subscriptions will expire in the time period specified on the gift subscription. Title to the gift subscription and the risk of loss, destruction or deterioration pass to the purchaser upon purchase. We are not responsible for any gift subscriptions that are lost, stolen, destroyed or used without your permission. In the event a gift subscription is non-functional, your sole remedy, and our sole liability, will be the replacement of such gift subscription.
        </p>
        <p>
         From time to time, other types of promotional codes may be available, including those provided as part of a third party promotion. Promotional codes may be redeemed as described in the specifics of the promotion. Promotional codes can only be used once, cannot be redeemed for cash, and may be subject to certain restrictions as determined by us in our sole discretion. If you received a promotional code through an offer by a third party, additional conditions may apply.
        </p>
        <p>
         We may offer trials of the Subscription Photobook App for a specified period without payment (a "Trial"). We reserve the right, in our absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial, and to withdraw or to modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability. For some Trials, we will require you to provide a Payment Method to start the Trial. At the end of such Trials, we may automatically start to charge you for the Subscription Photobook App on the first day following the end of the Trial, on a recurring monthly basis. By providing a Payment Method in conjunction with the Trial, you agree to this charge. You will not receive a notice from us that your Trial has ended or that the paying portion of your subscription has begun. If you do not want this charge, you must cancel your Subscription Photobook App by contacting customer service at
         <a href="mailto:info@printfix.com">
          info@printfix.com
         </a>

         </a>
         (for the Groovebook mobile app) before the end of the Trial.
        </p>
        <p>
         The monthly subscription fee for the Subscription Photobook App will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your subscription and each month thereafter unless and until you cancel your subscription. We automatically bill your Payment Method each month on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying subscription. Subscription fees are fully earned upon payment. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular if your Payment Method has not successfully settled. We may contact you via e-mail if there is a problem with your Payment Method or you can view this information at any time in the mobile app. You may also contact customer service at
         <a href="mailto:info@printfix.com">

          info@groovebook.com
         </a>
         (for the Groovebook mobile app) at any time with any billing questions. In the event your paying subscription began on a day not contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment Method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started your Subscription Photobook App on January 31st, your next payment date will likely be February 28th, and your Payment Method would be billed on that date.
        </p>
        <p>
         Payments are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used subscriptions. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the Subscription Photobook App through the end of your current billing period. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration ("credits"). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.

         We will make reasonable efforts to keep the Subscription Photobook App operational. However, certain technical difficulties or maintenance may, from time to time result in temporary interruptions.

         SHUTTERFLY VIDEO PLAN
        </h2>
        <p>
         Shutterfly Video Plan ("Video Plan") is a subscription program designed to offer customers certain benefits from Shutterfly. With a membership to the Video Plan, members are entitled to the benefits outlined below, subject to the requirements and limitations of these Terms.  If you register for membership in the Video Plan or use the Video Plan, you accept these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Video Plans allow for the storage and playback of video files ("Video Content").    The fees for Video Plans will vary depending on storage capacity and other features.  A fuller description of the Video Plan service features and pricing associated with each plan type is available at
         <a href="https://shutterfly-2.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1851">

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         If you exceed the limits of your plan, you may be prevented from adding more video content, and you will be prompted to upgrade your plan.  You may upgrade your plan at any time by accessing the "Settings" section of the "Shutterfly Photos" area of the Site (photos.shutterfly.com).  You may also downgrade your plan at any time by contacting customer support at
         <a href="mailto:customerservice@cs.shutterfly.com">
          customerservice@cs.shutterfly.com
         </a>
         .  If you downgrade your plan, you may be unable to upload video content in excess of the limits of your downgraded plan and may no longer have access to certain features. In the event that you continue to have video content in excess of the limits for your plan level, you will be prompted to either upgrade your plan or delete video content to free up storage. If you do not delete sufficient video content, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your plan.
        </p>
        <p>
         By enrolling in the Video Plan, you expressly allow us to charge a fee to the payment method ("Payment Method") you selected during purchase (or to a different Payment Method if you change your billing information) at the then-current rate, and any other charges or taxes that may apply in connection with your use of the service. As used in these Terms, "billing" will indicate either a charge or debit, as applicable, against your Payment Method. You will be billed at the start of your Video Plan and each year thereafter, unless and until you cancel your subscription. In the event we are unable to charge an applicable renewal fee to your Payment Method for more than thirty (30) days after the beginning of a renewal term of your subscription to the Video Plan, Shutterfly reserves the right to terminate, suspend or restrict your membership in the Video Plan.  In such event, you may no longer be allowed to upload additional Video Content. You agree that it is your responsibility to keep your Payment Method up-to-date.  We expressly reserve the right to suspend or terminate your membership and subscription in the event we are unable to charge to your Payment Method. Go to "My Plan" in the "Settings" section of the Shutterfly Photos area on the Site (

        </p>
        <p>
         If you are currently enrolled in an annual Video Plan, we will inform you by email before automatically renewing your Video Plan.  Each Video Plan will renew for an additional term at the end of the current term. Unless otherwise specified, the automatically renewed plan will be for the same term and will be at the same price and at the same service level as your prior plan. We will notify you in advance of any change in the amount to be charged for the renewed plan in the pre-renewal notification.  Each automatic renewal and corresponding payment will be processed on the first day of the new term.

         Shutterfly may, in its sole discretion, and without notice modify the terms and conditions of the Video Plan. We also reserve the right at any time to change the pricing and/or subscription fee as well as plan benefits offered such as storage capacity or features.

You agree that it is your sole responsibility to review updated terms and conditions of the Video Plan posted by us at www.shutterfly.com. If any such change is found to be unenforceable, void, invalid, it is severable and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining changes or conditions.

         Shutterfly reserves the right to terminate, suspend or restrict your membership and Video Plan, with or without notice, for any or no reason whatsoever. Without limiting the foregoing, Shutterfly may terminate your membership in the Video Plan if you violate the Terms or any applicable law, terms and conditions of any services offered by us, or if your use of our services or the Video Plan is determined, in our discretion, to involve fraud or misuse. Failure to enforce any termination rights for any conduct shall not be deemed a waiver of any of our termination rights.

         In the event of cancellation, expiration, downgrade or termination of your membership and Video Plan, you may be unable to access your Video Content and you may no longer be allowed to upload additional Video Content.

        <p>
         While we are not obligated to review User Submitted Materials for copyright infringement, we are committed to protecting copyrights and expect users of our Sites and Apps to do the same. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that any material used or displayed on or through our Sites and Apps infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow us to locate the material on our Sites and Apps; (d) the name, address, telephone number and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see

        <h2>
         ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
        </h2>
        <p>
         If you are a Shutterfly customer in the United States (including its possessions and territories), you and Shutterfly agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Shutterfly service, these Terms of Use and this Arbitration Agreement, shall be determined by binding arbitration or in small claims court. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Use, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Shutterfly are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your Shutterfly account.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you elect to seek arbitration or file a small claim court action, you must first send to Shutterfly, by certified mail, a written Notice of your claim ("Notice"). The Notice to Shutterfly must be addressed to: General Counsel, Shutterfly, Inc., 2800 Bridge Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065 ("Notice Address"). If Shutterfly initiates arbitration, it will send a written Notice to the email address used for your account. A Notice, whether sent by you or by Shutterfly, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If Shutterfly and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Shutterfly may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court.
        </p>
        <p>
         You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at
         <a href="http://www.adr.org/" rel="nofollow">
          www.adr.org
         </a>
         . If you are required to pay a filing fee, after Shutterfly receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, Shutterfly will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US$10,000, in which event you will be responsible for filing fees.
        </p>
        <p>
         The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at
         <a href="http://www.adr.org/" rel="nofollow">
          www.adr.org
         </a>
         , by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement. Unless Shutterfly and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county of your residence.
        </p>
        <p>
         If your claim is for US$10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds US$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Shutterfly's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if Shutterfly did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then Shutterfly will pay you the amount of the award or US$1,000, whichever is greater. Except as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
        </p>
        <p>
         YOU AND SHUTTERFLY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Shutterfly agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
