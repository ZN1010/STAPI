<h2>1. Who May Use the Vimeo Service</h2>
<p>AGE REQUIREMENT: You must be at least 13 years old to use the Vimeo Service. If you are at least 13, but are still a minor (this depends on where you live), you must have your parent or legal guardian's permission to use the Vimeo Service. Please have him or her read this Agreement with you.</p>
<p>NOTICE TO PARENTS AND GUARDIANS: By granting your child permission to use the Vimeo Service, you agree to the terms of this Agreement on behalf of your child. You are responsible for monitoring and supervising your child's use of the Vimeo Service. If your child is using the Vimeo Service and is either under 13 or does not have your permission, please contact us immediately so that we can disable his or her access. If you have questions about whether the Vimeo Service is appropriate for your child, please review our Frequently Asked Questions or contact us .</p>
<p>WARNING: Even if you are old enough to use the Vimeo Service and/or have your parent's or guardian's permission, some of the content available within the Vimeo Service may not be appropriate for you. Some content may contain "R-rated" material, nudity, profanity, and mature subject matter. If you are under 18, do not view such content.</p>
<h2>2. License to Use the Vimeo Service</h2>
<p>LICENSE: Vimeo grants you a limited, non-exclusive license to access and use the Vimeo Service for your own personal, non-commercial purposes. This includes the right to view content available on the Vimeo Service. This license is personal to you and may not be assigned or sublicensed to anyone else.</p>
<p>COMMERCIAL USE: You may not use the Vimeo Service for commercial purposes unless:</p>
<p>You are a Vimeo PRO or Vimeo Business user, in which case you may use and access the Vimeo Service for commercial and non-commercial purposes, subject to compliance with the Vimeo Guidelines ; or</p>
<p>You are a small-scale independent production company, non-profit, or artist, in which case you may use the Vimeo Service to showcase or promote your own creative works.</p>
<p>If you sell Vimeo-hosted videos directly to users other than through Vimeo On Demand, such usage will be deemed an "Application" under our API Terms (whether you use our API or not) and will be subject to our API Terms.</p>
<p>RESTRICTIONS: Except as expressly permitted by Vimeo in writing, you will not scrape, reproduce, redistribute, sell, create derivative works from, decompile, reverse engineer, or disassemble the Vimeo Service or any source code therein. Nor will you attempt to circumvent any of Vimeo's technical measures or take any measures to interfere with or damage the Vimeo Service. All rights not expressly granted by Vimeo are reserved.</p>
<p>MOBILE APP: Your use of the Vimeo Service through one of our mobile applications is also subject to our Mobile App Addendum .</p>
<h2>3. Privacy</h2>
<p>Your privacy rights are set forth in our Privacy Policy , which forms a part of this Agreement. Please review the Privacy Policy to learn about:</p>
<p>What information we may collect about you;</p>
<p>What we use that information for; and</p>
<p>With whom we share that information.</p>
<h2>4. Membership</h2>
<p>REGISTRATION: To fully use the Vimeo Service, you must register as a member by providing a user name, password, and valid email address. You must provide complete and accurate registration information to Vimeo and notify us if your information changes. If you are a business, government, or non-profit entity, the person whose email address is associated with the account must have the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement.</p>
<p>USER NAME: We encourage you to use your real name. If you are a business, government, or non-profit entity, you must use the actual name of your organization. You may not use someone else's name, a name that violates any third party right, or a name that is obscene or otherwise objectionable.</p>
<p>ACCOUNT SECURITY: You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account, including any activity by authorized or unauthorized users. You must not allow others to use your account credentials and you must safeguard the confidentiality of those credentials. If you are using a computer that others have access to, you must log out of your account after using the Vimeo Service. If you become aware of an unauthorized access to your account, you must change your password and notify us immediately .</p>
<p>SEAT ACCESS: If you are a PRO or Business subscriber, you may grant access to your account to other Vimeo members subject to a seat limit. You are responsible for the actions of those persons insofar as your account is concerned. If you are a Vimeo member who has been granted access to a PRO or Business account, you must comply with the terms of this Agreement in accessing that account.</p>
<h2>5. Subscriptions and Purchases</h2>
<p>VIMEO PLUS, PRO AND BUSINESS: In addition to offering Basic (free) Vimeo memberships, we offer Vimeo Plus, PRO, and Vimeo Business subscriptions. Please see our subscription pages for current Plus , PRO , and Business features and pricing. Features and prices are subject to change. Storage limits are calculated based upon source files. We reserve the right to charge for excessive use of bandwidth where plays occur on third-party sites and applications outside the native Vimeo player or apps. Anyone who wishes to obtain storage capacity beyond what is offered with the Vimeo Business subscription, or additional bandwidth for applications not using the Vimeo player may request a custom account by contacting us here: vimeo.com/help/contact . Additional terms and conditions (to be shown prior to purchase) apply to custom accounts. All fees may be subject to taxes.</p>
<p>CANCELATION AND REFUNDS: Users who purchase annual subscriptions have thirty (30) days after their purchase to cancel and receive a full refund. Users who purchase monthly subscriptions have five (5) days after purchase to cancel and receive a full refund. After the cancelation period ends, all purchases are final and all fees paid are non-refundable, even if your account is later terminated by Vimeo. If your account is terminated due to your breach of this Agreement during the relevant cancelation period, you will not be refunded. If you have questions, please contact us .</p>
<p>RENEWALS: Subject to the terms hereof, you may choose to renew your subscription at the end of the subscription period. By default, all subscriptions are set to automatically renew for the same period of time as the original subscription. You may decline to renew at any time prior to the commencement of a renewal subscription. Vimeo reserves the right to deny subscriptions, renewals, and other purchases for any reason. Unused storage, plays, and other limits do not roll over to subsequent subscription periods.</p>
<p>END OF SUBSCRIPTION: When a Vimeo Plus, PRO, or Business subscription ends, the account automatically becomes a Basic (free) account and Vimeo may disable access to or delete any content to comply with Basic account limits. If you're using Vimeo for commercial purposes, you will need to maintain a Vimeo PRO, Business, or custom plan to continue hosting your videos. Your account and its content may be deleted if your subscription is not renewed.</p>
<p>OTHER PURCHASES: Purchases of other products and services through the Vimeo Service are subject to our Payment Addendum and to other terms and conditions that are presented to you at the time of purchase.</p>

<p>TERM: This Agreement begins on the date you first use the Vimeo Service and continues as long as you have an account with us.</p>
<p>ACCOUNT DELETION: You may delete your account at any time. Basic accounts may be deleted from the Vimeo Service if they remain inactive (i.e., the user fails to log in) for a continuous period of at least six (6) months. Subscription accounts will remain active until the end of the subscription term and any renewal term.</p>
<p>TERMINATION FOR BREACH: Vimeo may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) or block or remove any content you submitted if Vimeo determines that you have violated any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to damage Vimeo's reputation and goodwill. If Vimeo deletes your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for the Vimeo Service. Vimeo may block your email address and Internet protocol address to prevent further registration.</p>
<p>EFFECT OF TERMINATION/ACCOUNT DELETION: Upon termination, all licenses granted by Vimeo will terminate. Sections 6 and 11 though 16 shall survive termination. In the event of account deletion for any reason, content that you submitted may no longer be available. Vimeo shall not be responsible for the loss of such content.</p>
