      <h3>
       Limitations of Liability
      </h3>
      <p>
       Under no circumstances shall AddToAny be liable for direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages (even if AddToAny has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from any aspect of your use of the AddToAny site or the service, whether the damages arise from use or misuse of the AddToAny site or the service, from inability to use the AddToAny site or the service, or the interruption, suspension, modification, alteration, or termination of the AddToAny site or the service. Such limitation shall also apply with respect to damages incurred by reason of other services or products received through or advertised in connection with the AddToAny site or the service or any links on the AddToAny site, as well as by reason of any information or advice received through or advertised in connection with the AddToAny site or the service or any links on the AddToAny site.

You hereby grant AddToAny a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide and irrevocable right and license to utilize the Data to track, extract, compile, synthesize, aggregate, and analyze such Data, including, but not limited to, the creation of anonymous and promotional tracking data ("Tracking Data").

      </h3>
      <p>
       You agree to indemnify and hold AddToAny, its officers, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, directors, officers, agents, service providers, suppliers and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including attorney fees and court costs, made by any third party due to or arising out of Content you submit, post or make available through the Service, your use of the Service, your violation of the TOS, your breach of any of the representations and warranties herein, or your violation of any rights of another.

       General Information
      </h3>
      <p>
       The TOS constitute the entire agreement between you and AddToAny and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and AddToAny. The TOS and the relationship between you and AddToAny shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and AddToAny agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of San Francisco, California. The failure of AddToAny to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
