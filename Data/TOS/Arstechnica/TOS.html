<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This User Agreement and Privacy Policy governs each website, mobile 
site, application, and/or other service, regardless of how distributed, 
transmitted, published, or broadcast (each, a “Service”) provided by 
Condé Nast, its parent, subsidiaries and/or affiliates (“we,” “us,” or 
“our”) that links to this User Agreement and Privacy Policy, which is 
binding on all those who access, visit and/or use the Service, whether 
acting as an individual or on behalf of an entity, including you and all
 persons, entities, or digital engines of any kind that harvest, crawl, 
index, scrape, spider, or mine digital content by an automated or manual
 process or otherwise (collectively, “you” or “your”). Please read this 
User Agreement and Privacy Policy carefully. You can access this User 
Agreement and Privacy Policy any time in the footer of the Service’s 
home page or initial screen. <strong>Your access, visitation and/or use 
of the Service, including without limitation any registration on any 
aspect of the Service, will constitute your agreement to this User 
Agreement and Privacy Policy.</strong> If you do not agree with the 
terms and conditions of this User Agreement and Privacy Policy, you may 
not access, visit and/or use the Service. The User Agreement and Privacy
 Policy may be modified from time to time; the date of the most recent 
revisions will appear on this page, so check back often. Continued 
access of the Service by you will constitute your acceptance of any 
changes or revisions to the User Agreement and Privacy Policy. If you 
breach, violate, fail to follow, or act inconsistently with the rules, 
restrictions, limitations, terms and/or conditions that apply to the 
Service, whether listed in this User Agreement and Privacy Policy, 
posted at various points in the Service, or otherwise communicated to 
users of the Service (collectively, the “Agreement”), we may terminate, 
discontinue, suspend, and/or restrict your account/profile, your ability
 to access, visit, and/or use the Service or any portion thereof, and/or
 the Agreement, including without limitation any of our purported 
obligations hereunder, with or without notice, in addition to our other 
remedies. In addition, we may curtail, restrict, or refuse to provide 
you with any future access, visitation, and/or use of the Service. We 
reserve the right, in addition to our other remedies, to take any 
technical, legal, and/or other action(s) that we deem necessary and/or 
appropriate, with or without notice, to prevent violations and enforce 
the Agreement and remediate any purported violations. You acknowledge 
and agree that we have the right hereunder to an injunction without 
posting a bond to stop or prevent a breach or violation of your 
obligations under the Agreement. In the event of any conflict or 
inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this User Agreement 
and Privacy Policy, and any rules, restrictions, limitations, terms 
and/or conditions that may be posted at various points in the Service or
 otherwise communicated to users of the Service, we shall determine 
which rules, restrictions, limitations, terms and/or conditions shall 
control and prevail in our sole discretion, and you specifically waive 
any right to challenge or dispute such determination. Among other 
things, the Agreement governs all text, articles, photographs, images, 
graphics, illustrations, creative, copy, artwork, video, audio, music, 
podcasts, ringtones, games, trademarks, trade names, service marks, and 
other brand identifiers, designs, plans, software, source and object 
code, algorithms, data, statistics, analysis, formulas, indexes, 
registries, repositories, and all other content, information, and 
materials (collectively, “Content”) available on or through the Service,
 whether posted, uploaded, transmitted, sent or otherwise made available

and/or other users or third parties, including any such Content uploaded
 manually or bookmarked by you and/or other users.</p></li>

<h3>Monitoring</h3>
<p>We strive to provide an enjoyable online experience for our users, so
 we may monitor activity on the Service, including in the social, 
community and public discussion areas, photo and video galleries, 
bulletin boards, forums, chats, blogs, personal/job search and other 
classified ads, and elsewhere, to foster compliance with the Agreement. 
You hereby specifically agree to such monitoring. Nevertheless, we do 
not make any representations, warranties or guarantees that: (1) the 
Service, or any portion thereof, will be monitored for accuracy or 
unacceptable use, (2) apparent statements of fact will be authenticated,
 or (3) we will take any specific action (or any action at all) in the 
event of a challenge or dispute regarding compliance or non-compliance 
with the Agreement. We generally do not pre-screen Content before it is 
posted, uploaded, transmitted, sent or otherwise made available on or 
through the Service by users, so you may be exposed to Content that is 
opinionated, offensive, and/or inappropriate, including Content that 
violates the Agreement.</p></li>
<li>
<h3>What to Do if You Have a Complaint Against Another User</h3>
<ol>
<li>Remember that by using the publicly accessible portions of our 
Service you may be exposed to Content that is opinionated, offensive, 
and/or inappropriate, including Content that violates the Agreement, but
 not all of such Content is actionable. We ask that you not use the 
Service, or lodge complaints against other users, to facilitate a 
personal dispute. If you have a legitimate complaint about another user,
 please do the following:
<ul>
<li>Harassment: If you have reason to believe that another person is 
using the Service in a way that is harmful to you (e.g., to impersonate 
or imitate you, or to stalk, bully, threaten, intimidate or otherwise 
harass you), we urge you to contact your local authorities, or 
appropriate state or federal agencies.</li>
<li>Copyright Complaints: If you have reason to believe that your 
Content has been copied and/or is accessible on the Service in a way 
that constitutes copyright infringement, or that the Service contains 
links or other references to another site, application, destination or 
service that contains Content or activity that infringes your copyright 
rights, you may notify us as described below in the section entitled 
Copyright Complaints.</li>
<li>CyberCrime: If you have reason to believe you may be the victim of 
an online crime, such as identity theft, fraud, infringement, or 
hacking, you may contact the Internet Crime Complaint Center, at <a href="http://www.ic3.gov/" target="_blank" tabindex="-1">www.ic3.gov</a>,
 a partnership between the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the 
National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C), and the Bureau of Justice 
Assistance (BJA).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> FALSE OR INACCURATE ACCUSATIONS THAT 
OTHERS HAVE COMMITED A CRIME, INAPPROPRIATE ACT, OR VIOLATION OF THIS 
AGREEMENT, COULD BE A VIOLATION OF CRIMINAL AND/OR CIVIL LAW, OR 
OTHERWISE EXPOSE YOU TO LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES (INCLUDING COSTS AND 
ATTORNEYS’ FEES).</li>

<h3>Registration Information:</h3>
<ol>
<li>We may at times require that you register for certain products 
and/or services, and/or to make purchases, or register and/or set up an 
account/profile to access, visit and/or use certain portions of the 
Service, or the Service as a whole, in which case you may be provided, 
or required to choose, a password and/or User ID, and you may provide a 
credit, debit, or charge card number, or other payment information, as 
well as your name, telephone number(s), email and/or street address, and
 other personally identifiable information. Other information such as 
your age, gender, an avatar, and the number for your mobile or other 
device may also be requested. In addition, you may be asked to send us 
similar information via messaging (e.g., email, SMS, MMS, or other 
technologies). All such information shall be referred to in the 
Agreement as your “Registration Information”. We may use and share your 
Registration Information as described in our Privacy Policy.</li>
<li>B. You agree, represent, warrant, and guarantee that all 
Registration Information provided by you is true, accurate, complete, 
up-to-date, and solely yours. You may not impersonate, imitate or 
pretend to be somebody else when registering and/or setting up an 
account/profile on the Service. If any of your Registration Information 
changes, you must update it promptly by using the mechanism or contact 
information on the Service that allows you to change or update your 
Registration Information, if available. If no such mechanism or contact 
information is available on the Service, please notify our Privacy 
Policy Coordinator as described in our Privacy Policy. WE AND OUR 
INDEMNITEES (AS DEFINED BELOW), SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH 
OR ARISING FROM YOUR FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ACCURATE, COMPLETE OR 
UP-TO-DATE REGISTRATION INFORMATION, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION YOUR 
FAILURE TO RECEIVE CRITICAL INFORMATION. NEITHER WE NOR OUR INDEMNITEES 
SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR VERIFYING YOUR REGISTRATION INFORMATION.</li>
<li>We reserve the right at any time, with or without notice, to remove 
or require a change to or repossess any password and/or User ID that has
 been provided to you, any avatar you may be using or other Registration
 Information, or otherwise change the access means or methods for 
portions of the Service, the Service as a whole, or certain products 
and/or services.</li>
<li>You will be solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality 
of your Registration Information. You may not authorize or permit anyone
 else to access and/or use your Registration Information, or access, 
visit and/or use the Service by use of your account/profile and/or 
Registration Information. You may not access and/or use anyone else’s 
Registration Information, or access, visit and/or use the Service by use
 of anyone else’s account/profile and/or Registration Information. You 
may not sub-license, transfer, sell, rent or assign your Registration 
Information to any third party without our written approval. Any attempt
 to do so will be null and void and shall be considered a material 
breach of the Agreement.</li>
<li>You are solely responsible for all access or visitation to, usage 
of, or activity on, your account/profile including, but not limited to, 
use of the account/profile by any person who uses your Registration 
Information, with or without authorization, or who has access to any 
computer, mobile or other device on which your account/profile resides 
or is accessible. You acknowledge and agree that we may, and you 
specifically authorize us to, process all transactions, including 
without limitation purchases and/or registration for additional 
merchandise, products and/or services, including without limitation 
Content, that are initiated by use of your Registration Information.</li>
<li>If you have reason to believe that your account/profile is no longer
 secure (for example, in the event of a loss, theft or unauthorized 
disclosure or use of your Registration Information), you must 
immediately change the affected Registration Information by using the 
mechanism or contact information on the Service, if available, and/or 
close the account/profile. If no such mechanism or contact information 
is available on the Service, please immediately notify our Privacy 
Policy Coordinator as described in our Privacy Policy.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Fees and Payments:</h3>
<ol>
<li>We and our licensors, vendors, and/or service providers may charge 
you fees for merchandise, products and/or services, including without 
limitation Content, offered for sale, rental or auction on or through 
the Service, and/or for access to portions of the Service or the Service
 as a whole. You agree to pay all fees and charges, including applicable
 taxes and surcharges, incurred through your activity on or through the 
Service and/or through your account/profile at the rates in effect for 
the billing period in which such fees and charges are incurred (such 
fees, charges, taxes, and surcharges shall collectively be referred to 
as “Fees”). Unless otherwise specified on the Service, all Fees will be 
quoted and charged in U.S. dollars. We and our licensors, vendors, 
and/or service providers reserve the right to change the amount of, or 
basis for determining, any Fees, and to institute new Fees, effective 
upon publication of such revised pricing on the Service.</li>
<li>If you submit a credit, debit, or charge card number, or other 
payment information to us upon registration, at the time of purchase, or
 otherwise, you authorize, give us permission, and direct us to retain 
such information and to charge all Fees to such payment method.</li>
<li>We may charge Fees in advance and on a daily, monthly, yearly, lump 
sum, or other basis. Fees for certain merchandise, products and/or 
services, including without limitation Content, may be invoiced on your 
mobile carrier’s bill. We may, in our sole discretion, charge Fees to 
your designated payment method individually, or elect to aggregate Fees 
for some or all of your purchases. All Fees are due promptly and are 
non-refundable. You must notify us about any billing problems or 
discrepancy within thirty (30) days after they first appear on your 
statement; otherwise, you waive any right to challenge or dispute such 
problem or discrepancy.</li>
<li>If Fees cannot be charged to the payment method you designate, or 
payment is returned to us for any reason, including charge back, we 
reserve the right, in addition to our other remedies, to: (i) demand 
immediate payment of all outstanding Fees due to us from you; (ii) 
assess an additional 1.5 percent late charge, or the highest amount 
allowed by law, whichever is lower; (iii) take any and all lawful steps 
necessary to collect Fees owed to us, and you will be responsible for 
all costs and expenses incurred in connection with such collection 
activity, including collection fees, court costs, and attorneys’ fees; 
(iv) charge such Fees to any other payment method you have on file with 
us; and (v) terminate, discontinue, suspend, and/or restrict your 
account/profile, your ability to access, visit and/or use the Service or
 any portion thereof, and/or the Agreement, including without limitation
 any of our purported obligations hereunder.</li>
<li>In addition, you are responsible for obtaining and maintaining at 
your own expense all equipment, hardware, software, and telephone, 
mobile, wireless, Internet and other services necessary to access, visit
 and/or use the Service. If you are accessing the Service via a mobile 
device, your mobile carrier may charge you fees for data, text 
messaging, and other mobile access or communications services.</li>
