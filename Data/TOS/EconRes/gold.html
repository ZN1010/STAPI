<p>The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis ("Bank") undertakes to obey all relevant copyright laws, and does not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property rights on its websites. Bank will review all claims of copyright infringement received and remove content deemed to have been posted or distributed in violation of any such laws.</p>
<p>Bank will promptly terminate without notice any registered user's access to its limited access websites if that user is determined by Bank to be a "repeat infringer." A repeat infringer is a registered user who has been notified by Bank of infringing activity violations more than twice and/or who has had their content or any other user-submitted content removed from the Bank's website more than twice. Bank may also at its sole discretion limit access to any limited access site and/or terminate the memberships in any limited access site of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.</p>
<p>(a)	If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any user content or other content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing our Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):</p>
<p>A physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or the person authorized to act on its behalf;</p>
<p>A description of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed; or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;</p>
<p>A description of the infringing material and information reasonably sufficient to permit the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis to locate the material;</p>
<p>Your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and email;</p>
<p>A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</p>
<p>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under the pains and penalties of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</p>
<p>(b)	If you believe that your user content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the content in your user content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information:</p>
<p>Your physical or electronic signature;</p>
<p>Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;</p>
<p>A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; and</p>
<p>Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in St. Louis, Missouri, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</p>
<p>If a counter-notice is received by Bank, Bank may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Bank's sole discretion.</p>
