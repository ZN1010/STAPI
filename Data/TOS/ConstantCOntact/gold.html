<h2>4. Fees; Payment; Taxes.</h2>
<h2>4.1. Fees.</h2>
<p>(a) Fee Schedule . Once you have completed any applicable free trial period or exceeded any limits described on the applicable fee schedule (the "Fee Schedule"), you will be subject to fees in accordance with any applicable Fee Schedule. Applicable fees will be billed monthly or your pre-paid account will be debited monthly for the Products, even if you are not actively using the Products. The applicable Fee Schedule is subject to change at any time in our sole discretion, and if you do not agree to any such changes, you should contact us to cancel your account. We will use good faith efforts to notify you prior to the effectiveness of any significant change to the applicable Fee Schedule, but you are responsible for reviewing the applicable Fee Schedule from time to time and remaining aware of the fees charged by us and any applicable discounts. You acknowledge and agree that our measurements are the definitive measurements for payment due and owed hereunder.</p>
<p>(b) Other Billing Arrangements . If you receive the Products by means of one of our re-sellers or partners (a "Reseller"), the Reseller may be responsible for billing you for the Products and you may be subject to a different fee schedule and additional terms and conditions. You are responsible for reviewing your fee schedule and any additional terms and conditions. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Reseller’s terms and conditions, this Agreement shall control except with respect to the payment provisions set forth in this Section 4. If you cease to be a customer of a Reseller, any special pricing, benefits or terms may no longer be available to you. We may rely on information provided by the Reseller, if any, with respect to the status of your Constant Contact account.</p>
<p>(c) Disputes . Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, any disputes about any charges to you under this Agreement must be submitted to us in writing within 60 days of the date such charges are incurred. You agree to waive all disputes not brought within the 60 day period, and all such charges will be final and not subject to challenge.</p>
<h2>4.2. Payment; Taxes.</h2>
<p>(a) Payment . Payment for the Products will be made in advance by a payment method accepted by us. Checks (including e-checks or those sent by mail) will be accepted for prepayments of at least six months. Fees are only payable in the currencies made available to you when you purchase our Products. If the monthly payment option is selected or if you have previously provided us with your credit card or other payment method for payment, you hereby authorize us to charge by that payment method for such amounts on a regular monthly basis beginning at the end of any applicable free trial period and continuing until such time as your Constant Contact account is terminated. If we are for any reason unable to effect automatic payment, we will attempt to notify you by email and your Constant Contact account may be disabled until payment is received or we may, in our discretion, place your account in “suspend” status and charge you based on the then-current suspend fee schedule.</p>
<p>(b) Taxes . We collect and remit tax from our customers located in certain state, local and foreign jurisdictions where software delivered as a service is taxable and where we have either physical, economic, affiliate or click-through nexus or permanent establishment.

Fees set forth in the applicable Fee Schedule do not take into account any taxes.</p>
<p>You agree to be responsible for and to pay any sales, personal property, use, VAT, excise, withholding, or any other taxes that may be imposed, based on this Agreement, use or possession of the Site or the Products or your products or services (except for taxes based on net income payable by us).</p>

<h2>5. Access and Use of the Site and the Products.</h2>
<h2>5.1. Prohibition on Spam; Permission Practices; Message Requirements.</h2>
<p>(a) Prohibition on Spam; Permission Practices . The Site and the Products may not be used for the sending of unsolicited email messages (sometimes called "spam"). All messages sent by means of the Site or the Products shall be in compliance with our Anti-Spam Policy .</p>
<p>You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the Site and the Products do not generate a number of spam or other complaints in excess of industry norms. We may terminate your access to or use of the Site and the Products if we determine that your level of spam or other complaints is higher than industry norms, as determined by us in our sole discretion. As a matter of privacy, we will not share with you information about those recipients who complain about your use of the Products or file a spam report against you.</p>
<p>You agree to import, access or otherwise use only contact lists in connection with the Site and the Products for which all listed parties have consented to receive correspondence from you (such as by opting into your "Join My Mailing List" link). It is not sufficient consent to receive email correspondence from you if a person or organization participates in a survey or registers for an event, clicks "Like" on your Facebook® page, or "follows" you on Twitter®. If you have used our feature that allows you to request a recipient to confirm that you have the recipient's permission to send messages to such recipient (assuming such use is permitted by laws applicable to you), and such recipient has not responded or does not respond affirmatively to such request for confirmation, you agree that you shall not send messages to that recipient. You agree not to send messages through the Site or the Products to distribution lists, newsgroups, publicly available press or media addresses or purchased email addresses.</p>
<p>We reserve the right without notice to take all measures of any nature (whether legal, technical or otherwise) to prevent unsolicited bulk email and/or other unauthorized email, messages or campaigns from entering, utilizing or remaining within our network.</p>
<p>(b) Messages . In your use of the Site or the Products, you shall represent yourself or your organization accurately and will not impersonate any other person, whether actual or fictitious.</p>
<p>You agree that you are the sole or designated "sender" (as such term is defined in the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and any rules or regulations adopted under such act (the "CAN-SPAM Act")) of any message sent by you using the Site or the Products. Similarly, for messages sent to Canadian email accounts, you are the sole person sending or causing or permitting the message to be sent by you using the Site or the Products (within the meaning of Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation, S.C. 2010, c. 23 ("Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation")).</p>
<p>You agree that for any email message sent by you using the Site or the Products, (i) the "from" line of any email message sent by you using the Site or the Products will accurately and in a non-deceptive manner identify your organization, your product or your service, (ii) the "subject" line of any email message sent by you using the Site or the Products will not contain any deceptive or misleading content regarding the overall subject matter of the email message, and (iii) you will include your valid physical address, which, if you are located in the United States, may be a valid post office box meeting the registration requirements established by the United States Postal Service.</p>
<p>(c) Unsubscribe . Every email message sent in connection with the Products must contain an "unsubscribe" link that allows subscribers to remove themselves from your mailing list and a link to the then-current About Our Service Provider description. Each such link must remain operational for at least 60 days after the date on which you send the message, and must be in form and substance satisfactory to us. You agree that you will not remove, disable or attempt to remove or disable either link. You shall monitor and process unsubscribe requests received by you directly within 10 days of submission and update the email addresses to which messages are sent through your Constant Contact account. You cannot charge a fee, require the recipient to give you any personally identifying information beyond an email address, or make the recipient take any step other than sending a reply email or visiting a single page on an Internet website as a condition for honoring an unsubscribe request. As required under the CAN-SPAM Act and other applicable laws, you acknowledge that you are responsible for maintaining and honoring the list of unsubscribe requests following termination of your Constant Contact account and this Agreement.</p>
<p>You agree that you shall not utilize the Site or the Products to send any message the primary purpose of which is the commercial advertisement or promotion of a commercial product or service (including content on an Internet website operated for a commercial purpose) (a "commercial electronic mail message" as defined in the CAN-SPAM Act or Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation) to any person who has opted out or otherwise objected to receiving such messages from you or another sender on whose behalf you may be acting.</p>

<p>If you signed up to use the Site or the Products prior to June 7, 2016, the following terms shall apply:</p>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. All legal actions in connection with the Agreement shall be brought in the state or federal courts located in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>If you signed up to use the Site or the Products on or after June 7, 2016, the following terms shall apply:</p>
<p>You hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in connection with any dispute relating to, concerning or arising out of this Agreement, whether in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory. The arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator and will be held at the AAA location in Boston, Massachusetts, unless you are a “consumer” as defined under the AAA rules. Disputes with consumers, as therein defined, will be resolved by binding arbitration conducted under the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules, as applicable. Consumers may request that the arbitration occur in or near the city/state stated in your account record with us. The procedures for commencing an arbitration are available here (provided however, that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court only on an individual, non-class basis).</p>
<p>ARBITRATION MUST BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. THIS MEANS NEITHER YOU NOR WE MAY JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION BY OR AGAINST OTHER SUBSCRIBERS OR USERS, OR LITIGATE IN COURT OR ARBITRATE ANY CLAIMS AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF A CLASS OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY.</p>
<p>Only a court, and not an arbitrator, shall determine the validity and effect of the class action waiver. Even if all parties have opted to litigate a claim in court, you or we may elect arbitration with respect to any claim made by a new party or any new claims later asserted in that lawsuit.</p>
<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in this paragraph. In the event you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.</p>
<p>No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. If you initiate a litigation or any other proceeding against us in violation of this paragraph, you agree to pay our reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with its enforcement of this paragraph.</p>
<p>The parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and any award, including the hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</p>
<p>This Agreement and the rights of the parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, exclusive of conflict or choice of law rules.</p>
<p>The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs. 1-16).</p>
