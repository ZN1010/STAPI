       <p>
        (a)
        <u>
         Fee Schedule
        </u>
        . Once you have completed any applicable free trial period or exceeded any limits described on the applicable fee schedule (the "Fee Schedule"), you will be subject to fees in accordance with any applicable Fee Schedule. Applicable fees will be billed monthly or your pre-paid account will be debited monthly for the Products, even if you are not actively using the Products. The applicable Fee Schedule is subject to change at any time in our sole discretion, and if you do not agree to any such changes, you should contact us to cancel your account. We will use good faith efforts to notify you prior to the effectiveness of any significant change to the applicable Fee Schedule, but you are responsible for reviewing the applicable Fee Schedule from time to time and remaining aware of the fees charged by us and any applicable discounts. You acknowledge and agree that our measurements are the definitive measurements for payment due and owed hereunder.
       </p>
       <p>
        (b)
        <u>
         Other Billing Arrangements
        </u>
        . If you receive the Products by means of
one of our re-sellers or partners (a "Reseller"), the Reseller may be
responsible for billing you for the Products and you may be subject to a
different fee schedule and additional terms and conditions. You are
responsible for reviewing your fee schedule and any additional terms and
conditions. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the
Reseller’s terms and conditions, this Agreement shall control except with
respect to the payment provisions set forth in this Section 4. If you cease
to be a customer of a Reseller, any special pricing, benefits or terms may
no longer be available to you. We may rely on information provided by the
Reseller, if any, with respect to the status of your Constant Contact
account.
       </p>
       <p>
        (c)
        <u>
         Disputes
        </u>
        . Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, any disputes about any charges to you under this Agreement must be submitted to us in writing within 60 days of the date such charges are incurred. You agree to waive all disputes not brought within the 60 day period, and all such charges will be final and not subject to challenge.

       <p>
        (a)
        <u>
         Payment
        </u>
        . Payment for the Products will be made in advance by a payment method accepted by us. Checks (including e-checks or those sent by mail) will be accepted for prepayments of at least six months. Fees are only payable in the currencies made available to you when you purchase our Products. If the monthly payment option is selected or if you have previously provided us with your credit card or other payment method for payment, you hereby authorize us to charge by that payment method for such amounts on a regular monthly basis beginning at the end of any applicable free trial period and continuing until such time as your Constant Contact account is terminated. If we are for any reason unable to effect automatic payment, we will attempt to notify you by email and your Constant Contact account may be disabled until payment is received or we may, in our discretion, place your account in “suspend” status and charge you based on the then-current suspend fee schedule.
       </p>
       <p>
        (b)
        <u>
         Taxes

        . We collect and remit tax from our customers located in certain state, local and foreign jurisdictions where software delivered as a service is taxable and where we have either physical, economic, affiliate or click-through nexus or permanent establishment. We determine your local taxing jurisdiction based on the billing address that you list in the "My Account" section of your Constant Contact account. Fees set forth in the applicable Fee Schedule do not take into account any taxes.

       <p>

        You agree to import, access or otherwise use only contact lists in connection with the Site and the Products for which all listed parties have consented to receive correspondence from you (such as by opting into your "Join My Mailing List" link). It is not sufficient consent to receive email correspondence from you if a person or organization participates in a survey or registers for an event, clicks "Like" on your Facebook® page, or "follows" you on Twitter®. If you have used our feature that allows you to request a recipient to confirm that you have the recipient's permission to send messages to such recipient (assuming such use is permitted by laws applicable to you), and such recipient has not responded or does not respond affirmatively to such request for confirmation, you agree that you shall not send messages to that recipient. You agree not to send messages through the Site or the Products to distribution lists, newsgroups, publicly available press or media addresses or purchased email addresses.

        You agree that you are the sole or designated "sender" (as such term is defined in the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and any rules or regulations adopted under such act (the "CAN-SPAM Act")) of any message sent by you using the Site or the Products. Similarly, for messages sent to Canadian email accounts, you are the sole person sending or causing or permitting the message to be sent by you using the Site or the Products (within the meaning of Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation, S.C. 2010, c. 23 ("Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation")).

You agree that you will not remove, disable or attempt to remove or disable either link. You shall monitor and process unsubscribe requests received by you directly within 10 days of submission and update the email addresses to which messages are sent through your Constant Contact account. You cannot charge a fee, require the recipient to give you any personally identifying information beyond an email address, or make the recipient take any step other than sending a reply email or visiting a single page on an Internet website as a condition for honoring an unsubscribe request.

       </p>
       <p>
        Only a court, and not an arbitrator, shall determine the validity and effect of the class action waiver. Even if all parties have opted to litigate a claim in court, you or we may elect arbitration with respect to any claim made by a new party or any new claims later asserted in that lawsuit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in this paragraph. In the event you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.
       </p>
       <p>
        No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. If you initiate a litigation or any other proceeding against us in violation of this paragraph, you agree to pay our reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with its enforcement of this paragraph.
       </p>
       <p>
        The parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and any award, including the hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.
       </p>
       <p>
        This Agreement and the rights of the parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, exclusive of conflict or choice of law rules.
       </p>
       <p>
        The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs. 1-16).
