<p>These terms make up an agreement between BlogTalkRadio, Inc., any individuals or companies affiliated with or which succeed it (“BTR”), and you. These Terms apply to your use of the BTR website, service applications, products and content provided by BTR (the “BTR Services”), globally, in existence now or in the future. You acknowledge that prior to using the BTR Services you have read these Terms carefully and agree to be bound by them. These Terms control your use of the BTR Services even if they are inconsistent with other information you have read. Please don’t use BTR Services if you don’t agree with these Terms (as well as all other policies and rules that BTR has posted on its website or provided to you).</p>
<p>You further acknowledge that these Terms may be amended. If this occurs, BTR will give you reasonable advance notice on the BTR website so that you can review the amendments and terminate your account within the notice period if you don’t agree to them. If you don’t terminate your account by the time the amendments go into effect, your continued use of the BTR Services will be subject to the amended Terms.</p>
<p>You also acknowledge that if you are using the BTR Services, you are not a child (in other words, you are over the age of 13) and agree that your use of the BTR Services will not violate any law or regulation. If you are a child below the age of 13, consider yourself lucky because you can stop reading now (since BTR does not allow you to use BTR Services and will terminate your profile and registration when it discovers that you are too young to be here). BTR will also terminate the profile and services of anyone who violates these Terms.</p>
<h2>In brief...</h2>
<p>By using BlogTalkRadio.com you agree to the terms below.</p>
<h2>2. Your Account with BTR</h2>
<p>Before using BTR Services, you will need to register with BTR and give us some basic background information. Your registration constitutes an acknowledgement that you will use the BTR Services for your own personal purposes. If you want to use the BTR Services for commercial purposes, you will have to sign up for our Revenue Engine (which provides a very easy way to make money on your podcasts distributed using the BTR platform). You also agree that you will not copy or distribute the BTR Services in any medium unless we know about it and you use our technology to do so.</p>
<p>We hope that you are interested in using our services because you like the BTR platform. That being said, you agree not to alter or change the BTR Services other than as needed to make them work for you. Your registration with BTR and use of the BTR Services allows us to include your user name and descriptions of Your Content (as defined below) in a directory or promotions on the BTR website, and to display visual material simultaneously with the delivery of Your Content if it is transmitted audibly.</p>
<p>As a company committed to improving the world of podcasting, we strive to create innovations that make a difference in our users’ lives and have gone to great lengths to deliver them. If you are in a business similar to BTR’s, please do not register for the BTR Services. By registering with us or continuing to use the BTR Services, you acknowledge that you are not a contractor, or an affiliate, employee or owner of a podcast hosting, streaming, syndication, measurement, or monetization service provider. You also acknowledge and agree that you will not disclose information to other parties about BTR’s business processes and technologies, and that you will not attempt to recreate BTR’s business processes and technologies for the purpose of engaging in or offering a service similar to BTR’s.</p>
<h2>In brief...</h2>

<h2>3. Basic BTR Services are Free!</h2>
<p>Believe it or not, unless you are using BTR’s premium services, your non-commercial use of the basic BTR Services is free. If we ever decide to charge you in the future for basic BTR Services, we will let you know ahead of time. If you are interested in using BTR’s premium services for a fee, please click here .</p>
<h2>In brief...</h2>
<p>Most basic services are free. Really.</p>
<h2>4. Creation and Transmission of Podcasts</h2>
<p>BTR enables you to set up a host channel and create audio webcasts and/or podcasts, and metadata and supporting content, including audio files, video files, text and images (collectively, “Your Content”), which are transmitted using BTR’s audio webcasting, hosting and syndication platform. BTR continually works to improve the technology used to deliver the BTR Services, and will notify you of changes to the way you create and submit Your Content by posting them on the BTR website.</p>
<h2>In brief...</h2>
<p>The BlogTalkRadio platform helps you with all the technical aspects of hosting managing and distributing your podcasts. We will keep improving our services for you.</p>
<h2>5. Syndication</h2>
<p>BTR facilitates the syndication of its users’ podcasts by creating RSS Feeds via Atom/RSS or other similar protocols (the “BTR RSS Feeds”). Once you set up a BTR account, BTR will create a BTR RSS Feed of Your Content that you may use as a means to syndicate Your Content to channels like iTunes, Stitcher, Podcast App, Overcast and many others. We will also provide a means for you to embed Your Content on your website via an embeddable widget.</p>
<p>In order to simplify and unify the process of tracking consumption of Your Content across multiple platforms, you agree to use the BTR RSS Feed as the primary syndication feed for Your Content to other platforms, and to use the provided embeddable BTR player as a means to embed Your Content on your website/blogs (where it is possible to embed from a technical or policy perspective).</p>
<p>Your cooperation with this provision ensures that our systems can obtain a more complete view of the listening activity with respect to Your Content and allows us to effectively market your show to potential sponsors and advertisers.</p>
<h2>In brief...</h2>
<p>You agree to use the RSS feed from BlogTalkRadio to distribute your podcast as broadly as you like. This also helps us more accurately measure your listenership.</p>
<h2>6. BTR’s License</h2>
<p>As sole owner of Your Content, you grant us the right to use it. In other words, you grant BTR (and any of its affiliated companies, licensees or assignees) a perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive right and license on a world-wide basis to transmit, perform and publicly display digitally, distribute and syndicate Your Content for all purposes, to the extent permitted by law. This will allow BTR to transmit, on a world-wide basis, and permit its end users (and other internet website operators and their end users) to access Your Content on the BTR website and applications, affiliated services and syndication channels. Pay close attention because this is important: except for the rights expressly granted in this paragraph, BTR does not gain any further interest in or right to use Your Content, all of which shall remain solely with you.</p>
<h2>In brief...</h2>

<h2>8. Content Access Rules</h2>
<p>BTR has worked for years to develop a unique and useful platform, and we are protective of it. We ask that your use of the BTR Services take this into account. You may not use any “deep-link”, “page-scrape”, “robot”, “spider” or other automatic device, program, algorithm or methodology, or any similar or equivalent manual process, to access, acquire, copy or monitor any portion of the BTR website or its content except via BTR RSS Feeds and application programming interfaces. This rule does not apply to you if you are operating a search engine that is an exposed public web service designed solely to help discover and direct users to the BTR website and the content created by our creator community.</p>
<p>When downloading audio content from the BTR website or BTR RSS Feeds, you may not cache the BTR RSS Feeds or linked audio content in a way that would obscure the actual download activity of users within your application. You are also prohibited from in any way reproducing or circumventing the navigational structure or presentation of the BTR website or any of its content. You acknowledge and agree not to obtain (or attempt to obtain) any materials, documents or information from the BTR website through any means not purposely made available by BTR.</p>
<h2>In brief...</h2>
<p>Please use the platform in the way it is intended to be used.</p>
<h2>9. Monetization and Advertising</h2>
<p>By using the BTR Services, you agree not to directly monetize Your Content via third party ad networks, agencies or business agreements. This restriction does not limit indirect monetization of Your Content, or services you offer outside of Your Content or your own promotions for those services. You may also include in Your Content advertising or sponsored messages/segments, but to do so you will need to either (i) notify BTR and receive written clearance or (ii) enroll in BTR’s Revenue Engine and use BTR’s ad systems in compliance with the advertisement/sponsorship policies of the BTR Revenue Engine. In fact, please note that if it is your intent to monetize Your Content, jumping aboard the BTR Revenue Engine is truly the best way to go, since it will allow BTR to work to maximize your potential earnings and provide an efficient way to remit to you the lion’s share of net revenues generated by Your Content. (See Revenue Engine section below).</p>
<p>By using the BTR Services, you are granting, and acknowledge that BTR in its sole discretion has, the right to serve banner, audio and video advertisements, including live reads, promotions, or other sponsored segments in connection with Your Content. You also acknowledge and agree that BTR may earn revenues associated with Your Content (including advertising fees, commissions, syndication fees and the like). It is our intent to work with the best advertisers and sponsors that do not compromise your editorial integrity, are not distasteful, and that do not interfere with the listening experience of Your Content. If you see or hear objectionable ads around or within Your Content, please email badads@blogtalkradio.com and our ad operations team will be happy to review these cases.</p>
<h2>In brief...</h2>
<p>You agree to allow BlogTalkRadio help you make money for you from your content and give the lion’s share of revenues to you. If you are already monetizing your content we won’t get in the way of those relationships.</p>
<h2>10. Revenue Engine</h2>
<p>To begin directly monetizing your content, and to enable BTR to remit to you your share of the revenues earned in connection with Your Content, your enrollment in the BTR Revenue Engine is required. Admittedly, these revenues might be very small as you ramp up your audiences, but they have the potential to grow! The BTR Revenue Engine assists BTR hosts by locating sponsors and advertisers for their BTR channel and content, and executing those sponsorships and advertising with BTR’s proprietary technologies. The full benefits of the BTR Revenue Engine are explained here.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the primary benefit of the Revenue Engine program is that it can allow you to receive the majority share of aggregate revenues earned against Your Content (less third party commissions and fees). BTR retains only a small share of these revenues, which allows us to take on the operational tasks of searching for advertisers and sponsors on your behalf, executing monetization instruments against Your Content using our proprietary technologies, and working behind the scenes to maximize your earning potential. This program frees up your time for more important things like focusing on your content and growing your listenership.</p>
<p>If you already have pre-existing long-term sponsorship arrangements generating sufficient revenues, please let our revenue team know via revengine@blogtalkradio.com. We do not want to jeopardize or limit these pre-existing relationships, and will work with you to ensure that you can fulfill your obligations to your pre-existing sponsors within our platform without limiting your total earning potential.</p>
<h2>In brief...</h2>
<p>You need to sign up with the Revenue Engine if you want to make money from your BlogTalkRadio content.</p>

<h2>13. Lawyer Stuff (which must be read CAREFULLY)</h2>

<p>No Waiver: Any delay or failure on the part of BTR to enforce any rights hereunder to which it may be entitled shall not be construed as a waiver of the right and privilege to do so at any subsequent time.</p>
