       STORIFY TERMS OF SERVICE
      </h1>
      <p>
       Last Updated Date: March 12, 2015
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for using Storify! Storify provides various services on storify.com, including a unique way to collect media from social networks and around the web to create your own original and beautiful stories which can be embedded on other websites (collectively, the âStorify Serviceâ).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Storify Service is owned by Livefyre, Inc. (âStorifyâ or âweâ). Please read carefully the following terms and conditions (âTerms of Serviceâ) and our Privacy Policy, which may be found at https://storify.com/privacy and which is incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service. These Terms of Service govern your access to and use of the Storify Service and constitute a binding legal agreement between you and Storify.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Key Content-related Terms
      </h3>
      <p>
       âContentâ means text, links, graphics, images, music, software, audio, video, information or other materials.
      </p>
      <p>
       âStorify Contentâ means Content that Storify makes available through the Storify Service, including any Content licensed to Storify from a third party (excluding Member Content and Third Party Content).
      </p>
      <p>
       âMemberâ means a person who completes Storifyâs account registration process, as described under âAccount Registrationâ below.
      </p>
      <p>
       âMember Contentâ means Content owned by a Member, including any story created by Member, that such Member posts, uploads, publishes, submits or transmits to be made available through the Storify Service.
      </p>
      <p>
       âThird Party Contentâ means Content owned by a third party that Member posts, uploads, publishes, submits or transmits to be made available through the Storify Service.
      </p>
      <p>
       âService Contentâ means Storify Content, Member Content, and Third Party Content.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certain areas of the Storify Service (and your access to or use of Service Content) may have different terms and conditions posted or may require you to agree with and accept additional terms and conditions. Storify may, in its sole discretion, make premium or different content available to you that is subject to different terms and conditions and narrower licenses than as set forth therein. If there is a conflict between these Terms of Service and terms and conditions posted for a specific area of the Storify Service or Service Content, the latter terms and conditions shall take precedence with respect to your use of or access to that area of the Storify Service or Service Content.
      </p>
      <p>
       YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, BY ACCESSING OR USING THE STORIFY SERVICE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, BY POSTING ANY CONTENT FROM OR ON OR THROUGH THE STORIFY SERVICE, YOU ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE REGISTERED WITH STORIFY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, THEN YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCESS OR USE THE STORIFY SERVICE. If you accept or agree to these Terms of Service on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms of Service and, in such event, âyouâ and âyourâ will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Modification
      </h3>
      <p>
       Storify reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify, discontinue or terminate the Storify Service or to modify these Terms of Service, at any time and without prior notice. If we modify these Terms of Service, we will post the modification on Storifyâs website or otherwise provide you with notice of the modification.    We will also update the âLast Updated Dateâ at the top of these Terms of Service. By continuing to access or use the Storify Service after we have posted a modification on Storifyâs website or have otherwise provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms of Service. If the modified Terms of Service are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Storify Service.

      </h3>
      <p>
       By uploading, submitting or otherwise providing any data and information (including but not limited to visual, audio, numeric, graphical, text, data, or other content) (collectively, âContentâ) you grant Livefyre and its subcontractors a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, paid-up, transferable right and license to host, cache, copy, store and display your Content for the purpose of and in conjunction with providing the Service.  You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your Content, including its legality, reliability, accuracy and appropriateness.  You represent and warrant that (a) you own or control all rights in and to your Content and have the right to grant the license above, (b) all of your Content does and will comply with these terms and (c) you will not post or submit Content that infringes or violates someone else's rights or otherwise violates the law. Livefyre can remove or block any Content or information if Livefyre believes that it violates the law, anotherâs rights or Livefyreâs policies.  If Livefyre removes your Content for infringing someone elseâs intellectual property rights, and you believe such Content was removed by mistake, Livefyre will provide you with an opportunity to appeal that decision in accordance with Section 2 below.  You further acknowledge and agree that (y) Livefyre has no obligation to monitor or police Content transmitted through the Service and (z) Livefyre shall not be responsible for, and shall have no liability for, any Content.

       </li>
       <li>
        A statement under penalty of perjury that you have âa good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled,â and
       </li>
       <li>
        Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court applicable for your address and that you will accept service of process from person who issued the takedown notice (in other words, you agree to be sued if it comes to that).
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Please send all such notices to copyright@livefyre.com.
