Any changes we make to these TOU will be effective immediately after we post modified TOU, notwithstanding the possibility that you may have a previous version cached on your browser.  The TOU that apply are the most recent version of the TOU that appear on a non-cached browser.  Your continued use of the Site after changes to these TOU have been published constitutes your binding acceptance of the updated TOU.</p>
<p>If, at any time, these TOU are no longer acceptable to you, you should cease using the Site immediately.</p>
<p>In addition to these TOU, certain services offered for purchase or use through the Site are subject to their own terms and conditions.  Please be sure to review the applicable terms and conditions when purchasing or using such services.  To the extent that there is a conflict between any terms of these TOU and the terms and conditions specific to such services, the service-specific terms and conditions will govern and control.  Certain services provided by PR Newswire and its affiliates (including MultiVu, as applicable) are subject to PR Newswire’s General Terms & Conditions, together with one or more of the service-specific supplements, which can be found at http://www.prnewswire.com/customer-terms-conditions-landing-page.html.</p>

<p>To the extent that the Site includes a model portfolio or actual portfolio of investments, your actual results may differ from results reported for the portfolio for a variety of reasons, including trading commissions not reflected in the portfolio, and market factors, such as lack of liquidity, timing of purchase, and frequency of trading.  Statements of past results are not indicative of future performance.</p>

<p>You may not alter, delete or conceal any copyright, trademark or other notices contained on the Site, including notices contained within or together with any PR Newswire Materials.</p>
<p>Any unauthorized or prohibited use of the Site, any PR Newswire Materials or other proprietary material may subject you to civil liability or criminal prosecution, or both, under applicable federal and state laws and regulations, as well as foreign laws, regulations and treaties.  You are solely responsible for determining and confirming your compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to use of PR Newswire Materials in a jurisdiction, including without restriction all laws and regulations applicable to intellectual property rights.
