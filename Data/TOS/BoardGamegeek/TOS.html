               <p>
                (i) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
                <br/>
                (ii) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;

For clarity, only DMCA notices should go to the Copyright Agent; any other feedback, comments, questions, or other communications may not be answered.

                <br/>
                (ii) Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
                <br/>
                (iii) A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; and
                <br/>
