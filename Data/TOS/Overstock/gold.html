<h2>USAGE BY MINORS</h2>
<p>This Site is not intended for or directed to persons who are minors (typically persons under the age of 18, depending on where you live). Because we cannot prohibit minors from accessing the Site, we must rely on parents, guardians and those responsible for supervising minors to decide which materials are appropriate for minors to view and/or purchase. By registering with this Site, purchasing products from us or providing us with any information, you represent to us that you are legally permitted to enter into a binding contract (18 years of age or older in most jurisdictions) or, if you are under the legal age of consent, you have the express permission from your parent or guardian and that any information you provide to us is not inaccurate, deceptive or misleading.</p>
<p>We require that all purchases be made either (i) by individuals who are not minors and who can legally enter into binding contracts (typically persons 18 years of age or older, depending on where you live), or (ii) by minors with the permission of a parent or guardian to purchase items on the Site.</p>
<h2>TOBACCO SALES TO MINORS</h2>
<p>We will not sell tobacco or tobacco related products to anyone who is not of legal age to purchase and use tobacco products under applicable law. We cannot be held responsible for minors purchasing tobacco or tobacco related products with a parent or guardian's credit card. By placing your order for tobacco or a tobacco related product you are confirming that you are of legal age to purchase and use tobacco products in the state, country or territory where you are based. We may restrict the purchase of tobacco related products in your area.</p>
<h2>APPLICABLE LAW</h2>
<p>If you access the Site from anywhere in the United States or Canada, you agree that the laws of the State of Utah, USA, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and Overstock.</p>
<h2>DISPUTES</h2>

These incorporated policies also govern your visit to the Site. We reserve the right to make changes to the Site, any incorporated policies, and these Terms at any time. If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.</p>
<h2>HOW TO ORDER THROUGH THE SITE</h2>
<p>After placing an order, you will receive an email from us acknowledging that we have received your order (“ Order Confirmation ”). Please note that this does not mean that your order has been accepted. Your order constitutes an offer to us to buy a product. All orders are subject to acceptance by us, and we will confirm such acceptance to you by sending you an email confirming the shipment of your order (the “ Shipping Confirmation ”). A contract with us will only be formed when we send you the Shipping Confirmation . The contract will relate only to those products whose shipment we have confirmed in the Shipping Confirmation . We will not be obliged to supply any other products which may have been part of your order in a separate Order Confirmation . We reserve the right to cancel your order at any time before we have accepted it and we may rescind our acceptance and cancel your order where there has been an obvious error in price or where the product is no longer in our or our third party fulfillment provider's inventory.</p>
<h2>PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND ERRORS</h2>
<p>Products on the Site are subject to change without notice. Errors will be corrected when discovered. Our Site contains a large number of products and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the products listed on our Site may be incorrectly priced, the quantity or availability of a product may have changed just prior to you placing your order or other errors may be displayed on the product page. We will normally verify prices, availability and confirm there are no errors on the product page as part of our dispatch procedures.</p>
<p>Where a product's correct price is less than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount when dispatching the product to you. If a product's correct price is higher than the price stated on our Site, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before dispatching the product, or reject your order and notify you of such rejection. We are under no obligation to provide the product to you at the incorrect (lower) price, even after we have sent you an Order Confirmation or a Shipping Confirmation , if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakable and could have reasonably been recognized by you as a pricing error.</p>
<p>On occasion, you may be able to place a product in your shopping cart and submit your order for processing, but your order is subsequently cancelled due to unavailability of product. You acknowledge that products may sell quickly and there may be a short period of time after an order has been submitted, but where the product is no longer available. You agree that we may cancel your order after you have received an Order Confirmation without penalty. On very rare occasions, you may receive a Shipping Confirmation from us, but the product is no longer available in our or our third party fulfillment provider's inventory. You agree that we may rescind our acceptance and cancel your order without penalty if we are unable to ship the product you ordered due to unavailability.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions on a product page. We reserve the right to rescind our acceptance and cancel your order without penalty in the event there is an obvious and unmistakable error on the product page, in our reasonable discretion. If you have already received your order, we will do our best to resolve your concern.</p>
<h2>COLLECTION OF TAX</h2>
<p>In states where we have no physical presence, we are not required to collect and remit sales tax for purchases. However, many states require that their residents file a sales or use tax return for items purchased on this Site. You should consult your state and local tax laws to determine compliance with tax laws and regulations in your area. In some states we collect and remit sales tax. For purchases where sales tax is applicable you will see the tax calculated on the checkout page before you are asked to confirm the purchase. We use reasonable commercial efforts to calculate and remit the correct amount of tax required on each taxable purchase, but we do not guarantee the accuracy of the amount of the tax we represent to you as the tax owed. Minor errors may occur owing to the inability to accurately track multiple taxing districts, state and local “tax holidays,” the timing of rate changes or the application of certain taxes to categories of items we sell. As a result of any error, we may overcollect or undercollect your tax. In consideration of our allowing you access to and use of the Site, and in collecting and remitting taxes required on your purchases, you hereby waive your right to claim that the tax collected on any purchase is incorrect in any respect and agree to hold us harmless, our officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives, for any harm or other damages you may incur as a result of our error in calculating the taxes you owe for your purchases.</p>
<h2>SHIPPING</h2>
<p>The term shipping or ship includes the commencement of shipping items in an order for multiple purchases or where the item purchased consists of components that must be shipped separately. For example, your order may consist of (1) several different items, (2) a quantity of the same item, or, (3) a single item with several component parts the size of which might require them to be shipped in separate packages. In all such orders, we endeavor to ship out individual packages together so that they arrive at the same time; however, when that is not possible, we commence shipping by shipping individual packages in the order the soonest they are available and conditions permit. In these instances, our notification to you that your order has “shipped,” marks the time when shipping has commenced; it does not mean that all items in the order have shipped at that time. All packages sent have a separate tracking number and may be followed on the Order Status page. You agree that credit cards and debit cards are to be charged on the date of inventory reservation for the order, not the date of shipping.</p>
<h2>RISK OF LOSS</h2>
<p>All items purchased through the Site are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon tender of the item to the carrier.</p>
<h2>OVERSTOCK'S MOBILE O™ CONDITIONS</h2>

Your phone carrier may prohibit or restrict certain mobile features, and they may be incompatible with your carrier or mobile device. Contact your carrier with questions regarding these issues.</p>
<p>You agree to notify us of any changes to your mobile number and update your account(s) with us to reflect this change. You also agree that we will not be liable for any delays in the receipt of any messages as delivery is subject to effective transmission from your network operator.</p>
<p>Data obtained from you may include your mobile phone number, your carrier's name, your opt-out status, and the date, time, and content of your messages. We may use this information to contact you and to provide you with the SMS services. All data collected is subject to our Privacy and Security Policy .</p>
<h2>SPECIAL TERMS FOR OUR NON-U.S. CUSTOMERS</h2>
<h2>Shipments through Bongo International, LLC</h2>
<p>Bongo International, LLC (“Bongo”) is one of our many fulfillment providers, and assists us in getting products to our international customers. When you click to the checkout page on the Site, you will be redirected to a checkout page hosted by Bongo to complete your order. On the checkout page you are required to select a method of payment. You will be required to submit payment (e.g., credit card) and personal information to Bongo to complete your order. Upon completion and approval of your order by Bongo, Bongo will notify us of the approval or denial of your order. Once notified by Bongo of your approval, we will process your order and ship the product directly from our warehouse; or cause one of our third party fulfillment providers to ship the product directly from their warehouse, to Bongo. Bongo will thereupon purchase the product from us thereby taking title to the product(s), bill your financial institution, collect and remit any duties and taxes to the appropriate taxing authority and arrange for the product to be delivered to your doorstep by common carrier. In this process, Bongo makes the sale to you as the merchant of record, but we are legally obliged to deliver the product(s) ordered as set out in these Terms. If you have any questions about products ordered, you should direct them to us and not to Bongo. When ordering a product, you will be presented with Bongo’s terms and conditions to which you must agree in order to receive the product(s) you ordered. If there is any inconsistency between these Terms and those presented by Bongo, these Terms will prevail .</p>
<h2>Shipments through Landmark Trade Services</h2>
<p>The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) administers the importation of foreign goods into Canada, including collection of customs duties and taxes. When a Canadian e-commerce customer (referred to by the CBSA as a casual importer) returns a product to a foreign e-commerce company and obtains a refund of the purchase price, the customs duties and taxes are returned as well. In order to streamline refunds and customs duties, the CBSA has developed a system called the Casual Refund Electronic Data Interchange System (CREDITS) by which Landmark Trade Services acts as the customer’s agent to process the refunds and customs duties on returns. By placing an order through Overstock for delivery in Canada, customers agree that in the event of a product return, they are waiving all rights to account and receive a refund directly from the CBSA, that they will receive a refund of duties and taxes from Overstock, and that they also authorize Landmark Trade Services to endorse the refund so that Overstock can be reimbursed for the amount it has already refunded the customer. Accordingly, the following limited Power of Attorney applies to such returns:</p>
<p>Landmark Trade Services is an approved CREDITS participant with the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). By ordering goods from Overstock.com, Inc., I hereby authorize Landmark Trade Services, an approved customs broker in CREDITS, to act as my agent, and to transact business with the CBSA to obtain release of my merchandise, account for duties and taxes, return merchandise to Overstock.com, Inc., and electronically submit refund claims on my behalf. Under the CREDITS program, I understand that the CBSA will send any refund of duties and taxes that were paid on the returned merchandise to the customs broker, and that I will obtain the refund directly from Overstock.com, Inc. Further, I also authorize Landmark Trade Services to forward any refund issued by the CBSA in my name, so that Overstock.com, Inc. can be reimbursed.</p>
<h2>Duties and Taxes</h2>
<p>International duties and taxes will be calculated and paid for at checkout. Overstock will process and inspect returns within 24-48 hours of arrival at its U.S. hub, and will promptly issue refunds thereafter. Overstock will cover return shipping costs on damaged, defective, or incorrect items. However, the customer will be responsible for return shipping on any items that are returned out of buyer’s remorse.</p>
<h2>Non-U.S. Pricing</h2>
<p>Pricing of products available for purchase by non-U.S. customers may vary by country and from our prices for our U.S. customers, owing to the inclusion of all or a portion of shipping, taxes, service fees, duties and imports factored into the price of the product. Overstock's Global Checkout will be in U.S. Dollars (USD) only. International customers will be able to take advantage of Overstock’s site-sales and certain coupons, but Club O is not currently available for international customers.</p>
<h2>Distance Selling Regulations</h2>
<p>If you are contracting as a consumer, you may cancel an order that we have accepted at any time within fourteen days, beginning on the day after you received the products. In this case, you will receive a full refund of the price paid for the products. Please note you must return the product to us and must pay the cost of returning the product to us under the applicable return policy, unless the product(s) are not those you ordered, in which case we will bear your costs of returning the product(s) in question to us.
