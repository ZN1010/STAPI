<h2>Terms of Service</h2>
<h2>About This Terms of Service</h2>
<p>The AOL company name has changed to Oath. Oath is part of the Verizon family of companies and consists of over 50 digital and mobile brands globally, including AOL. The Oath Terms of Service (TOS) consists of these terms, the Oath Privacy Policy , the Community Guidelines , and any supplemental terms provided to you for any of the products, services, software, websites, and other goods and services offered, owned, or operated by Oath Inc. (collectively “Services”). It is a contract in electronic form between you (“you,” “your,” and “yourself”) and Oath Inc. and its parents, successors, subsidiaries, affiliates, and family of brands (“Oath,” “we,” “us,” and “our”).</p>
<p>By using the Services or registering with us, you are agreeing to the TOS and may use our Services as long as you comply with the TOS.</p>
<h2>NOTICE OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</h2>
<p>THIS TOS CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</p>
<p>All disputes between you and Oath will be resolved by binding arbitration.  You thus give up your right to litigate disputes with us in court (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court).  Disputes will be decided by a neutral arbitrator and not a judge or jury.</p>
<p>You are entitled to a fair hearing, but arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than court proceedings.  Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court.</p>
<p>PLEASE REVIEW THE SECTION ENTITLED “HOW TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE WITH US” and see our FAQs for more information.</p>
<p>Registering a Username and Keeping Your Account Active</p>
<p>You will need a username to use some Services. A username is a unique identifier selected or supplied by you or provided by us and is used to identify you on our Services.</p>
<p>To register a username and create an account, you must be a United States resident and at least 13 years of age unless the Service expressly indicates otherwise. You must give us true and accurate information about yourself and keep that information up to date.</p>
<p>You may be able to use an e-mail address or other online identifier provided to you by someone other than us as a username. You are responsible for maintaining security and control over any e-mail address or online identifier provided to us as a username. If you fail to maintain security or control over such an e-mail address or other online identifier, you are responsible for any consequences and may lose access to your personal information and any data stored on our Services. Also, we are not responsible for the release or loss of any information that is identified with that address or identifier.</p>
<p>Your username and account may be terminated if you do not sign on to a Service with your username at least once every 90 days. If you are registered for fee-based or term-specific Services, we will not terminate your username or account unless they are subject to being terminated for some other reason. In addition, an individual Service may require you to sign in and use the Service periodically to remain active on that Service. If you fail to remain active on a specific Service, we may deactivate your access and use of that Service.</p>
<p>After we terminate or deactivate your account for inactivity or any other reason, we have no obligation to retain, store, or provide you with any data, information, e-mail, or other content that you uploaded, stored, transferred, sent, mailed, received, forwarded, posted or otherwise provide to us (collectively “posted” or “post”) on the Services and may allow another user to register and use the username. We also have no obligation to remove any public data, content, or other information that you posted on a Service or to reactivate your account.</p>

You may not create multiple usernames for sending unsolicited bulk communications or posting advertising or other notice on any Service. Any violation of these provisions may result in immediate termination of your account and legal action.</p>
<h2>Fee-Based Services and Billing</h2>
<p>We may offer fee-based Services. Our provision of those fee-based Services will be governed by the terms you agree to when you register for the fee-based Service and any terms in this TOS not inconsistent with those terms.</p>
<p>If you register for a fee-based Service, you must designate a payment method and provide us with accurate billing and payment information. All billing information, including payment method, must be kept up to date.</p>
<p>We will bill you for all fee-based Services through the payment method that is associated with any of your fee-based Services. You agree to pay us for all charges incurred under your account, including all applicable taxes, fees, and surcharges. You authorize and direct us to charge your designated payment method for these charges or, if your designated payment method fails, to charge any other payment method you have on file with us. Further, you authorize and direct us to retain information about the payment method(s) associated with your account. If we do not receive payment from your designated payment method or any other payment method on file, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by us.</p>
<p>We may charge for fee-based Services in advance and on a daily, monthly, yearly, lump sum, or other basis. We may, in our sole discretion, post charges to your payment method individually or aggregate charges for some or all of your fee-based Services with us.</p>
<p>Every time you use a fee-based Service, you reaffirm that (a) we are authorized to charge your designated payment method; (b) we may submit charges incurred under your account for payment; and (c) you will be responsible for such charges, even if your account is canceled by you or terminated by us.</p>
<p>Surcharges apply if you use certain payment methods, such as payment from your checking or savings account, or telephone bill.</p>
<p>Any trial promotion for a fee-based Service (such as free trial time for a paid Internet access service) must be used within the specified time of the trial. You must cancel your account before the end of the trial period to avoid being charged a subscription fee. However, even during any free trial or other promotion, you will still be responsible for any purchases and surcharges incurred using your account and any sub- or linked-accounts. We reserve the right to limit you to one free trial or promotion of a fee-based Service and to prohibit the combining of free trials, promotions, and other offers.</p>
<p>You can get information about billing or determine the status of your bill and the amounts of any surcharges for the Internet connectivity Service at http://help.aol.com . You can also contact a customer service representative at 1-800-827-6364.</p>
<p>All charges are nonrefundable unless provided otherwise in the terms you agree to when you register for a fee-based Service.</p>
<p>We, in our sole discretion, may change or discontinue any or all aspects of a fee-based Service without notice, including access to support services, content and other products or services ancillary to the fee-based Service.</p>
<p>We may change our fees and billing methods at any time. We will provide you with notice of any change in your pricing at least thirty (30) days in advance. If you disagree with any proposed change, your sole remedy is to cancel your fee-based Service before the price change takes effect. Your continued use of or subscription to the Service after the price change takes effect constitutes your agreement to pay the new price for the Service. We will not refund any charges if you choose to cancel your account for this reason.</p>
<p>After 30 days from the date of any unpaid charges, your fee-based Service will be deemed delinquent and we may terminate or suspend your account and fee-based Service for nonpayment. We reserve the right to assess an additional 1.5 percent late charge (or the highest amount allowed by law, whichever is lower) per month if your payment is more than 30 days past due and to use any lawful means to collect any unpaid charges. You are liable for any fees, including attorney and collection fees, incurred by us in our efforts to collect any remaining balances from you.</p>
<p>You are responsible for all charges incurred under your account, including applicable taxes, fees, surcharges, and purchases made by you or anyone you allow to use your account (including your children, family, friends, or any other person with implied, actual, or apparent authority) or anyone who gains access to your account as a result of your failure to safeguard your username, password, or other authentication credentials or information.</p>
<p>You must notify us about any billing problems or discrepancies within 90 days after they first appear on your billing method statement. If you do not bring them to our attention within 90 days, you agree that you waive your right to dispute such problems or discrepancies.</p>
<p>If you are using our fee-based dial-up Internet connectivity Service, you are responsible for any telephone charges you may incur to access the Internet. The use of a dial-up Internet connectivity number is the same as making a telephone call to that number and may result in additional charges on your telephone bill depending on your location and calling plan. The locations and area codes listed in connection with these numbers are not necessarily indicative of whether a call will be local or toll free for you. You should select dial-up Internet connectivity numbers carefully. Please call your local phone company to ensure that the dial-up number(s) you select are in the local calling area. This is especially important if there have been changes in area code designations, in your telephone service providers, or in your calling plan.</p>
<p>You agree that we may charge you and you will pay to use certain “toll free” telephone numbers (“Long Distance Access Numbers,” e.g., telephone numbers that begin with 800, 866, 877, 888, and other area codes that the telephone carriers may make available in the future) (“surcharge”) to access the Internet using one of our Services. Telephone carriers may or may not charge for using these Long Distance Access Numbers. Information on the amount of this surcharge and on available dial-up phone numbers is located at http://access.web.aol.com . You can incur long-distance or toll charges or surcharges for using a Long Distance Access Number even during a free trial.</p>
<p>You may cancel or we may terminate a fee-based Service at any time. You can cancel a fee-based Internet connectivity Service by calling, sending a fax, or mailing a letter to our Customer Service Department. Cancellation will take effect within 3 business days of receipt of your request. Complete information on our cancellation procedures for our fee-based Internet connectivity Service is available at http://cancel.aol.com/ . We will send you written confirmation of the cancellation of a fee-based Internet connectivity Service. If you cancel near the end of your billing period and are inadvertently charged for the next period’s fee, call us to have the charges reversed. If you subscribe to a fee-based Service other than Internet connectivity Service, you should consult the specific cancellation policies and procedures for those Services. If your fee-based Service is canceled or terminated, any data you have stored on such Services may not be retrievable later.</p>
<p>In the event that your fee-based Service is terminated or canceled, no online time or other credits will be credited to you or can be converted to cash or other form of reimbursement.</p>

<h2>How to Resolve a Dispute with Us</h2>
<p>We offer the following process to help you resolve a complaint or dispute that you may have with us.  Please read this section carefully.</p>
<p>Our customer support department, which you can reach at 1-800-827-6364, can help you resolve many of your concerns.  If our customer support team is unable to resolve your complaint, you agree to take the following steps to resolve any dispute you may have with us.</p>
<h2>Step 1. Notice of Legal Dispute</h2>
<p>You must first try to resolve any formal complaint or dispute with us through our Notice of Legal Dispute process. You begin by submitting a “Notice of Legal Dispute” by U.S. Mail to:</p>
<p>Oath Inc.</p>
<p>Attention: Notice of Legal Dispute</p>
<p>Dept. 5771</p>
<p>PO Box 65101</p>
<p>Sterling, VA 20165-8806</p>
<p>A “Notice of Legal Dispute” is a written form in which you provide your name, address, contact information, your AOL username, the facts regarding your Dispute, and the relief you are requesting from us.  You can get a Notice of Legal Dispute form by clicking here .</p>
<p>You and we will attempt to resolve any Dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice of Legal Dispute is received by a party. After sixty (60) days, you or we may initiate arbitration as described below.</p>
<p>You agree that the term “Dispute” in this TOS will have the broadest meaning possible. It applies to any dispute, action, or other controversy between you and us concerning the Services (including their price) or this TOS, whether in contract, warranty, tort, laws or regulation. The term also applies to any dispute over the validity, enforceability or scope of this arbitration provision.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Arbitration</h2>
<p>If your Dispute is not resolved to your satisfaction within 60 days from when we received your Notice of Legal Dispute, you and we agree to arbitrate all Disputes between us. As we explain below, you and we may also have the right to bring an individual action before a small claims court for certain claims.  You agree that arbitration or a small claims action will be your sole and exclusive remedy to resolve any dispute with us.</p>
<p>The Federal Arbitration Act applies to this TOS. By agreeing to arbitrate, you are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) any and all Disputes (except small claims) in court before a judge or jury. Instead, a neutral arbitrator will resolve all Disputes. To read more about arbitration, visit www.adr.org .</p>
<p>The American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules . If you are an individual and use the services for personal or household use, the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply. You may begin arbitration with us by completing a Demand for Arbitration form, available by clicking here . The completed form(s) should be returned directly to the AAA.  The AAA will assign someone to manage your case. You will be contacted with instructions for continuing the arbitration process. Be sure to keep a copy of everything you send to the administrator of your arbitration or us.</p>
<h2>Costs</h2>
<p>If your claim in arbitration is $75,000 or less, we will pay your filing fee, as well as other filing, AAA and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.  For all other arbitrations you initiate, the AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.  Information about filing fees for commercial arbitrations can be found in Section L-3 of AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules . If we, instead of you, initiate arbitration, we will pay all filing, AAA, and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. You may initiate arbitration only in your county of residence or in Loudoun County, Virginia. The AAA rules will determine whether the arbitration will take place through written submissions by you and us, by telephone, or in person.</p>
<p>We will not seek to recover from you our attorney’s fees or expenses in any arbitration. Fees and expenses are not counted in determining how much a Dispute involves.</p>
<p>Please be advised that if an arbitrator finds that the arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, then we will seek to recover from you our AAA arbitrator’s fees and expenses, and/or your filing fees that we paid.</p>
<h2>Incentive</h2>
<p>We offer the following incentive for users who arbitrate any Dispute with us for any claim that is under $10,000. If you reject our last written proposal to resolve your claim before an arbitrator was appointed (the “Proposal”), and the arbitrator awards you more than the amount of our Proposal, we will: (i) pay you the greater of the award or $1,000; (ii) pay twice your reasonable attorney’s fees, if any; and (iii) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration.</p>
<h2>Small Claims Option</h2>
<p>You may also litigate any Dispute in small claims court in your county of residence or Loudoun County, Virginia, USA, if the Dispute meets all requirements to be heard in the small claims court. However, if you initiate a small claims case, you are responsible for all court costs and you are not entitled to the incentives we offer to you above for arbitration.</p>
<h2>You Waive Any Class Action Claim</h2>
<p>Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, consolidation of your Dispute with other arbitrations, or any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity are not permitted and are waived by you, and an arbitrator will have no jurisdiction to hear such claims.</p>
<p>If a court finds that the class action waiver in this section is unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, then the class action waiver will not apply to those parts. Instead, those parts will be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of this Dispute resolution section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed with the remainder of this section remaining in full force and effect.</p>
<h2>Additional Terms</h2>
<p>You agree that the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia govern this contract and any claim or Dispute that you may have against us, without regard to Virginia’s conflict of laws rules. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall have no applicability.</p>
<p>Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the Agreement to arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or Dispute as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, you agree that any Disputes or claims that you may have against us reside in and will be resolved by a state or federal court located in Arlington County, Fairfax County, the City of Alexandria, or Loudoun County, Virginia and you agree and submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim or action.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU ARE:  (1) WAIVING CLAIMS THAT YOU MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE AGAINST US BASED ON THE LAWS OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING YOUR OWN; (2) IRREVOCABLY CONSENTING TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF, AND VENUE IN, STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA OVER ANY DISPUTES OR CLAIMS YOU HAVE WITH US; AND (3) SUBMITTING YOURSELF TO THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF COURTS LOCATED IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESOLVING ANY SUCH DISPUTES OR CLAIMS.</p>
<h2>Claims or Disputes must be filed within one year.</h2>
<p>To the extent permitted by law, any claim or Dispute under this TOS must be filed within one year in small claims court, an arbitration proceeding or in court, as applicable. The one-year period begins on the date when a Notice of Legal Dispute is filed with us.  You agree you are permanently barred to bring a claim for your Dispute if you do not file your claim within one year.</p>
<h2>General Legal Terms</h2>
<p>This TOS along with any supplemental terms for some Services constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Oath and replaces any prior agreements between you and Oath.</p>
<p>We may modify this TOS from time to time. If you do not agree to the changes, stop using our Services (and remember to cancel any fee-based services) before the changes take effect.
