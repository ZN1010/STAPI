<h2>2. Services Available</h2>
<h2>2.1 Free Version</h2>
<p>Webnode’s basic tool for creating and hosting websites is absolutely free of charge to each and all Users. The characteristics of Our free versions are specific to the type of site in question.

Currently, these include the features mentioned above, but also Premium Customer Care, backup and recovery, business statistics, customized footer, online advertising campaigns, and many more services already available or in process of being launched.</p>
<h2>3. Paid Services</h2>
<h2>3.1 Prices</h2>
<p>All of the services have a set price or a range of prices, according to the characteristics of the work required and the time devoted to accomplish it. These prices may be subject of adjustments to take into account market changes, or be temporary substituted by special/promotional prices. The values are set in the local currency, or in United States Dollars (USD). To review Our price table please click here .</p>
<h2>3.2 Acquisition of Premium Services</h2>
<p>All of Our Premium services are available at the Administration of Your project, but can also be accessed at https://us.webnode.com/pricing/ . For further information or to purchase one of Our Premium services, You can contact Our Customer Care department at https://us.webnode.com/contact/ .</p>
<h2>4. Domain Name (a Paid Service)</h2>
<h2>4.1 Domain Name Registration and Ownership</h2>
<p>The person or entity that acquires the domain is the lawful owner of it. Webnode intervenes solely as a Technical Administrator and interface (agent) between You and the organization that allocates the domain name. However, if You (the owner of the domain) decide not to renew the domain, Webnode is not responsible for any problems or issues that may occur as a result of or after the domain expired. Also, please be advised that not all domain types have a waiting period, hence if You do not renew the domain, You may lose the domain name to another Internet user.</p>
<h2>4.2 Domain Renewal</h2>
<p>The domain may be renewed from the date of the purchase until the day prior to the expiration date stated in the administration of the project. The expiration date refers to the day that Your domain will become invalid, hence will cease to function. Domain Renewal is considered paid when the Payment date precedes the expiration date. The payment date is set when the chosen payment entity (i.e., payment method provider) confirms the successful arrival of the payment. If Domain Renewal is not paid on time, the domain falls into the Quarantine. It is possible to redeem the domain from the quarantine, but an administrative fee will be charged. For gTLD (generic top level domain – e.g. com , net , org ) restore prices are 150 USD / 100 EUR. Restore prices for other TLDs may vary, starting at 150 USD / 100 EUR.</p>
<h2>4.3 Cancellation of Registration</h2>
<p>The domains are the property of who acquired them right from the moment of completed purchase; hence it cannot be revoked and reimbursement is, therefore, unfeasible.</p>
<h2>4.4 Private Domain Registration</h2>
<p>You can register a domain name and still maintain Your privacy/anonymity as a means to avoid receiving SPAM (unsolicited electronic messages), or being found on databases. During the registration process You are required to disclose Your contact information, though this will only be used for charging purposes ( i.e. , to create an invoice). Moreover, the information provided will not be disclosed. The service of private domain registration is provided by and is in compliance with the Conditions of Use of Anonymouse Domains, s.r.o., Registration Number: 28296800, based at Hlinky 995/70, Staré Brno, 603 00 Brno, or other third party. The Conditions of Use of the Service are listed here: http://www.anonymousedomains.com/service-agreement.html</p>
<h2>5. Contract and Contract Revocation</h2>
<h2>5.1 Contract</h2>
<p>A binding contract is initiated between You and Webnode, at the time You order a service and it will be uphold once the payment is successfully completed. “Successfully completed” is defined as full amount was paid and an invoice is available in the Administration of Your Webnode account, under “Back office” in the “Purchased services and billing section”. There is a “refundable period” of 15 days in which You can request for cancellation of the service. However, this process follows a specific set of criteria and rules (please refer to Paragraph 6.5 ).</p>
<h2>5.2 Contract Revocation</h2>
<p>Revocation of any service can be requested at any time if You do not intend to obtain the refund of paid fees. Also, revocation, acquisition of services, and request for changes in current services ( i.e. , whatever affects the functionality of Your project) must be presented by You (the owner of the project) in written form (by email), and from the email address used to register the project.</p>
<h2>5.3 Duration of the Contract</h2>
<p>The acquisition of website packages has a length of 1 year up to 10 years of contract. Domains have a minimum of 1-2 years (depending on provider’s conditions) and a maximum of 10 years of contract. For the remaining services, unless it is otherwise notified upon purchase, the contract ends once the service is provided.</p>
<h2>6. Payments/Fees and Refunds</h2>
<h2>6.1 Methods of Payment</h2>
<p>Premium services can be paid by Credit Card, PayPal, bank transfer, wire transfer, and other country-specific payment methods (including direct deposit on Webnode’s bank account).</p>
<p>In the case of bank transfers, all the information necessary is available on the Premium Service order form. Also, please notice that the surcharges resulting from the bank transfer are supported by You, not by Webnode.</p>
<p>Note: You are responsible to fill in Your information on the payment request. Please make sure that all fields are completed and that all data supplied is accurate. Webnode is not responsible for uncompleted requests due to wrong or insufficient User-information.</p>
<h2>6.2 Payment Processing</h2>
<p>If You use your credit card or PayPal to make a purchase, you authorize Webnode (either directly or through its affiliates, subsidiaries or other third parties) to collect the payment from your card or account. We will store your payment information during the checkout process for future use making future automatic renewals and purchasing of other services faster and more convenient. All payment processing is secure and PCI-compliant.</p>
<h2>6.3 Recurrent Payment (Automatic Renewal)</h2>
<p>If you use your credit card or PayPal to make a purchase, automatic renewal may be available in some cases. The frequency of renewal can be monthly or yearly, depending on the type of payment you selected. For yearly renewals, the amount is charged prior to the expiration date of the plan.</p>
<p>The automatic renewal can be cancelled at any time in the “Administration” of your project. You authorize Webnode to withdraw payment for services from your card or account until you cancel automatic renewals.</p>
<h2>6.4 Payment Date and Activation Date</h2>
<p>The payment date is set upon confirmation of successful reception of the amount in question by the payment entity chosen ( i.e. , payment method provider). Regarding payments made with Credit Card or through PayPal, the amount is deducted immediately from Your account. In addition, payment date and activation date are the same, unless the recovery of the fully paid order has to be done manually. In this case, the activation may be delayed for several days.</p>
<h2>6.5 Requests for Refund</h2>
<p>All Premium services, except for domain registration, are refundable within 15 days from the date of activation. The refund is possible only for Your first purchase of Premium services. Webnode will not refund any subsequent purchases, including the Automatic Renewal of services carried out by Recurrent Payment. Please note that vouchers are not refundable in any way or form.</p>
<p>It is not possible to refund already registered domains. In case You received a voucher for a free domain with the purchased Premium package and You request the refund after your domain has been registered, the amount refunded will be equivalent to the price of the package excluding the value of the domain.</p>
<p>If - in case of online advertising campaigns - a third party (Google) decides to block the created campaign due to questionable product/service the campaign offers, it is not possible to request a refund. In such case, Webnode is not responsible for the potential financial loss of the User.</p>
<p>To request contract revocation, You must send an email to Our Customer Care department (please refer to Article 5).</p>
<p>For cancellation of website packages within the 15-day period, no justification is necessary; though it is encouraged as We use it as an information source.</p>
<p>In the case of authorized request to cancel any Premium service, except for website packages and domain registrations, You must provide a reason for the cancellation. For all cases mentioned above, the reasons that may trigger a refund are:</p>
<p>(a) Full termination of all services (including free versions);</p>
<p>(b) Repeating technical issue with the service, that impairs the normal function of Your project;</p>
<p>(c) Failure to provide service that was paid in full (with confirmation of payment).</p>
<p>Note: Webnode reserves the right to review the cancellation reason You stated and to decide upon acceptance or denial of Your request.</p>
<h2>6.6 Date and Method of Refund</h2>
<p>Refund of the fees paid will take place up to 60 days starting from the date of Webnode’s notification of refund, and will be processed through the same payment method (except in the case of direct deposit) or by a non-refundable reimbursement voucher. The deactivation is done at the same time as the refund.</p>
