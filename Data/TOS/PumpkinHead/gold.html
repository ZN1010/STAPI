<h2>Pumpkinhead, Inc. / about.me Terms of Service</h2>
<div>Effective date: February 4, 2013</div>
<p>The following terms and conditions govern all use of about.me, its content, services and applications (the “Services”), including any other applications that link to this agreement.</p>
<p>BY ACCESSING, USING, OR REGISTERING FOR THE SERVICES, YOU CONFIRM THAT YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS (the “Agreement”). If you do not agree, you may not use the Services.</p>
<h2>About the Services</h2>
<p>Pumpkinhead, Inc., its parent and affiliates (“we” or “us”) make available the Services to you on the condition that you abide by this Agreement. The Services give users the ability to access and share their profiles and other content. We may, in our sole discretion, change any aspect of the Services or discontinue any Service without notice. The Services are based in the United States. The Services are not designed or customized for any other country; you may use them only if they comply with the laws of the country from which you are accessing our Services.</p>
<p>Please read this Agreement carefully before creating, accessing or using the Services. You understand and agree that this Agreement governs your relationship with us and has the same effect as an agreement in writing.</p>
<h2>Your about.me Account and Site</h2>
<p>Registration is optional; however, you will need to register with us and create a username to use certain Services and features. A username is a unique identifier selected or supplied by you or provided by us and is used to identify you on our Services. To register a username and create an account, you must be at least 13 years of age. You must give us true and accurate information about yourself and keep that information up to date. We may refuse or reject a username in our discretion.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>If you create a profile on the Services, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and profile, and you are fully responsible for all consequences and activities that occur under your account. You must not describe or assign keywords to your profile in a misleading or unlawful manner, including in a manner intended to trade on the name or reputation of others, and we may change or remove any description or keyword that it considers inappropriate or unlawful, or otherwise likely to cause us liability. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of security.</p>
<h2>Passwords</h2>
<p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Services and for any activities or actions under your password. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.</p>
<h2>Responsibility of Contributors</h2>
<p>If you create a profile, comment on a profile, or otherwise transmit or post materials (e.g., text, graphics, applications, etc.) on the Services (any such material, “Content”), you understand and agree that you are entirely responsible for such Content that is provided by you or through your account. This includes, for example, any personal information, such as your home address, the home address of others, or your current location that you may make available about yourself on the Services. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF SHARING OR POSTING ANY PERSONAL OR OTHER INFORMATION ON OUR SERVICES.</p>

<p>If you elect to store authentication information, such as a username and password, where others may access it, we are not responsible for any loss of personal data or other consequences if someone other than you uses that information to access our services. If you lose a device, such as a laptop, desktop, or smartphone, or a device is stolen containing your username and password, it is up to you to take all the steps necessary to protect yourself.</p>

<h2>Your License</h2>
<p>By submitting Content on the Services or by linking to other profiles on the Services for inclusion on your profile, you grant us and our parent a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing and promoting your profile.

<h2>Username Conflicts</h2>
<p>During the private invitation period, if you do not complete registration within 30 days of the time and date that the invitation email was sent, the username you reserved will become available to others. You may not impersonate another person or claim a name for your profile that does not belong to you (i.e. “name squatting”). We are committed to ensure the rights of trademark owners and the right of individuals in the public sphere to claim their legal names and associated monikers on the Services. You understand and agree that you will forfeit a username and your account if the rightful owner protests your claim, or if such username is associated with a trademark or celebrity.</p>
<h2>Services Fees</h2>

<h2>Fees and Payment</h2>
<p>We may offer from time-to-time optional premium paid services such as domain purchases, domain mapping, premium fonts and other features on the Services. By selecting to purchase a premium service, you agree to pay us the monthly or annual subscription fees indicated for that service. Payments will be charged on the day you sign up for a premium service and will cover the use of that service for a monthly or annual period as indicated. Premium service fees are not refundable.</p>
<p>You must designate a payment method and provide us with accurate billing and payment information. All billing information, including payment method, must be kept up to date. We will bill you for all fee-based Services through the payment method that is associated with any of your fee-based Services. You authorize and direct us to charge your designated payment method for these charges or, if your designated payment method fails, to charge any other payment method you have on file with us. Further, you authorize and direct us to retain information about the payment method(s) associated with your account. If we do not receive payment from your designated payment method or any other payment method on file, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by us. Every time you use a fee-based Service, you reaffirm that (a) we are authorized to charge your designated payment method; (b) we may submit charges incurred under your account for payment; and (c) you will be responsible for such charges, even if your account is cancelled by you or terminated by us.</p>
<h2>Trial Services</h2>
<p>Any trial promotion for a fee-based Service must be used within the specified time of the trial. You must cancel your account before the end of the trial period to avoid being charged a subscription fee. However, even during any free trial or other promotion, you will still be responsible for any purchases and surcharges incurred using your account and any sub- or linked-accounts. We reserve the right to limit you to one free trial or promotion of a fee-based Service and to prohibit the combining of free trials, promotions, and other offers.</p>

This Agreement does not transfer to you any of our or third party intellectual property. Nothing in this Agreement grants you a right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any of our or third party’s trademarks, service marks, logos and trade names.</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>We may modify this TOS from time to time. If you do not agree to the changes, stop using our Services (and remember to cancel any fee-based services) before the changes take effect.

<h2>Termination</h2>
