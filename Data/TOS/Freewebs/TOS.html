       4. Website Content Control and User Data
      </h5>
      <p>
       You control the Websites you create using our Services and Webs does not claim any ownership rights in any text,
					files, images, photos, videos, sounds, musical works, comments, recommendations, forums, listings, logos,
					trademarks, postings, messages, tags, works of authorship, or any other work or authorship added to or submitted
					with any of the foregoing (collectively, "Content") posted by you or by Visitors or Members of your Websites.
					Therefore, Webs takes no responsibility for any Content located in your Website and Webs has no obligation to
					monitor such Content or your Website. You are therefore responsible for the removal of any such Content that is in
					violation of these Terms of Service and ensuring compliance with these Terms of Service.
      </p>
      <p>
       By visiting or becoming a Member of a Website created using our Services, you agree that the Content and information
					you provide during the registration process (including your email address) and other interactions with the Website
					may be accessed by the Website Creator and their authorized representatives and administrators, as well as any
					Application Developer whose Applications run on that Website. Similarly, by adding or using an Application or a
					service provided by one of our affiliates or business partners, you agree that the Content and information you or
					your Website Visitors or Members provide in the interactions with your Website as well as that Application or
					service may be accessed by the respective Application Developer, affiliate or business partner and their authorized
					representatives. We require Website Creators, Application Developers, affiliates and business partners to respect
					your privacy settings and our
       <a href="file:///C:/terms-of-service#privacy">
        Privacy Policy
       </a>
       , but your agreement with
					that Website, Application, affiliate or business partner will control how they can use the Content and information
					shared with them. Be sure to understand the privacy settings, terms and privacy policies of that Website,
					Application or service prior to your interactions. Note that Webs cannot guarantee that such third parties will
					comply with their contractual requirements, and Webs does not assume any liability or responsibility for any third
					party's actions, or for enforcing any agreements such third parties may enter into with your or with us.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a Website Creator, you and your authorized representatives and administrators will have access to the email
					address of the Members of your Website, along with certain information, Content and data provided or collected
					during their registration and use of your Website ("Website Member Data"). Webs may also provide you with access to
					certain Visitor data that we collect as part of our Services (collectively with Website Member Data and other data
					you collect, "User Data"). You agree to have a privacy policy or otherwise make it clear to your Visitors and
					Members what User Data you are going to use and how you will use, display or share that data. You further agree
					that, as between you and Webs, subject to this Agreement and each User's rights, (i) Webs owns all right,
					title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the User Data collected by us, and (ii)
					you own all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the User Data collected
					by you. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order for Webs to run your Website on the Sites, you hereby grant Webs a
					nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sub-licensable, fully paid-up, royalty-free right and
					license to (i) use, reproduce, store, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly perform and display
					the User Data on or through the Sites and in all current and future media in which the Services may be distributed;
					(ii) use and disclose the User Data and related metrics in an aggregate or other non-personally identifiable manner
					(including, for use in targeting advertising in a non-personally identifiable manner through and in connection with
					the Sites); and (iii) use User Data for other purposes permitted by the Webs Privacy Policy.

       <a name="obligation">
       </a>
       5. Your Obligation to Protect User Data
      </h5>
      <p>
       If you collect or have been provided access to User Data, you hereby agree not to use, display or share User Data in
					a manner inconsistent with the User's privacy settings, our Terms of Service and Guidelines, and all
					applicable laws and regulations. You hereby further agree that your use and disclosure of User Data shall be
					reasonably protective of each User's rights and in no event shall you observe standards of privacy and
					confidentiality in connection with the use and disclosure of User Data that are less stringent than the standards
					set forth in our
       <a href="file:///C:/terms-of-service#privacy">
        Privacy Policy
       </a>
       . You agree to promptly delete all User
					Data (i) relating to any User who de-authorizes, disconnects or otherwise disassociates from your Website,
					Application or service, (ii) if we disable your Website, Application or service, or (iii) upon request by us or the
					User. Webs is not required to keep back-up copies of User Data on the Sites once the Website or User Data is
					deleted. Webs makes no guarantee that User Data will be safely stored on the Sites. To be safe, you should
					independently back-up User Data, to the extent permitted herein and applicable laws and regulations. You acknowledge
					that Webs may terminate the account of any User (including Members of your Website(s) or users of your Application)
					in accordance with this Agreement.

       <a name="proprietary">
       </a>
       6. Proprietary Rights to Content
      </h5>
      <p>
       By displaying or publishing ("posting") any Content on or through the Services, you hereby grant to Webs a limited
					license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, publish, reproduce, distribute, list information
					regarding, edit, translate, and make derivative works of such Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media
					or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed for use solely in connection with the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without this license, Webs would be unable to provide the Services. The license you grant to Webs is non-exclusive
					(meaning you are free to license your Content to anyone else in addition to Webs), fully-paid and royalty-free
					(meaning that Webs is not required to pay you for the use on the Services of the Content that you post),
					transferable and sub-licensable (so that Webs is able to use its affiliates and subcontractors such as Internet
					content delivery networks to provide the Services), and worldwide (because the Internet and the Services are global
					in reach). Unless you have shared your Content with others, and they have not deleted it, this license will
					terminate at the time you remove your Content from the Services, but you understand and agree that your Content may
					continue to appear on the Sites or Websites after you remove it from the Services as portion of your Content may
					remain on pages cached by third parties, incorporated into RSS feeds, User profiles or other features, or archived
					on servers. Furthermore, when you publish any Content or information using the "everyone" or "public" settings, it
					means that everyone, including people off of the Sites, will have access to that information and we may not have
					control over what they do with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you post any Content on a Website, you provide the Website Creator, other Members of that Website or the public
					in general with permission to view and use your Content depending on the Website's privacy settings and
					policies. Be sure to understand that Website's privacy settings and policies prior to posting your Content.
      </p>
      <p>
       You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Services or otherwise have
					the right to grant the license set forth in this section, and (ii) the posting of your Content on or through the
					Services does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, intellectual property rights, contract rights or any
					other rights of any third party. You agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owing any person by
					reason of any Content posted by you to or through the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a Website is removed from the Sites, the Content associated with that Website may also be deleted at the
					discretion of the Website Creator or Webs. We encourage you to be sure you are comfortable with this possibility
					before contributing your Content to a Website. You should be aware that Webs is not required and may not keep
					back-up copies of Content (including your Content) on the Sites once the Website or Content is deleted.
					Additionally, Webs makes no guarantee, either during or after the term of this Agreement, that your Content will be
					safely stored on the Sites and you should independently back-up your Content.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Webs Services contain proprietary content that is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and
					other laws in the United States and around the world (the "Webs Content"). Webs owns and retains all rights in the
					Webs Content and the Services. Webs hereby grants you a limited, freely revocable, non-sublicensable license to
					reproduce and display the Webs Content (excluding any software code) solely for your personal use in connection with
					using the Services. As between you and the Sites, all the intellectual property rights in the Webs technology, which
					does not include your Content, are owned by Webs or its licensors.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Webs Services contain Content of Users and other Webs licensors. Except for Content posted by you, you may not
					copy, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, archive, transmit, distribute, perform, display, decompile, reverse
					engineer, attempt to access the source code, create derivative works from, rent or sell any Content appearing on or
					through the Services without permission of the Content owner.
      </p>
      <p>
       We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions you may have about Webs, but you understand that we may use
					them without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).

       9. Anti-SPAM
      </h5>
      <h3>
       What is webspam?
      </h3>
      <p>
       Webspam consists of web pages that are created with the intent of manipulating search engines algorithms for the
					purpose of unnaturally ranking a website or websites for specific keywords or search terms, often with the aim of
					monetary gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Webs takes spam and webspam seriously and will not tolerate spam or webspam in any of its forms. The following
					practices are NOT ALLOWED and are violations of Webs Terms of Service (ToS) agreement:
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Content Spam:
       </b>
       Webs does not allow the populating of user sites or web pages with popular and monetizable search terms.
       <br>
       <b>
        Link Spam:
       </b>
       Webs does not allow the creation of links to a page solely or primarily in order to increase its link-based score.
       <br>
       <b>
        Automatically/Programmatically Generated Content:
       </b>
       Webs does not allow content that has been generated programmatically. Programmatic content consists of paragraphs of
					random text that makes no sense to the reader, but which may contain search keywords.
       <br>
       <b>
        Keyword stuffing:
       </b>
       Webs does not allow the promotion of sites that use keyword stuffing, a technique where web pages are loaded
					with keywords to inflate the site's ranking.
       <br>
       <b>
        Cloaking:
       </b>
       Webs does not allow the promotion of sites that use cloaking, a technique where different content is served
					to search engines than to users.
       <br>
       <b>
        Sneaky JavaScript redirects:
       </b>
       Webs does not allow the promotion of sites that use sneaky Javascript redirects. Sneaky redirects are designed to
					deceive search engines or to display different content to human users than to search engines. It's a violation
					of Webs Terms of Service agreement to use JavaScript, a meta refresh, or other technologies to redirect a user to a
					different page with the intent to show the user a different page than a search engine crawler sees.
       <br>
       <b>
        Doorway pages:
       </b>
       Webs does not allow the promotion of web pages that are created solely to rank high in search engine results for
					particular phrases, with the purpose of then sending users to a different page. In many cases, doorway pages are
					written to rank for a particular phrase and then funnel users to a single destination.
       <br>
       <b>
        Trademark Content:
       </b>
       Webs does not allow the use of others' trademarks in the name, domain, subdomain or in linked headers of your
					website.
       <br>
       <b>
        Hidden text or links:
       </b>
       Webs does not allow hiding text or links in your content to manipulate search engine rankings. This is considered
					deceptive and is a violation of Webs Terms of Service agreement.
       <br>
       <b>
        Link Schemes:
       </b>
       Webs does not allow any links intended to manipulate a site's ranking in a search results page. User sites employing
					this tactic will be considered part of a link scheme and will be suspended. This includes any behavior that
					manipulates links to your site, or outgoing links from your site. Manipulating these links may affect the quality of
					search results, and as such is a violation of the Webs Terms of Service agreement.

       13. Other Paid Services
      </h5>
      <p>
       In addition to Premium Services, as a Website Creator you may purchase other paid services (collectively with
					Premium Services and Advanced Premium Services, the "Paid Services") which may be provided as a one-time transaction
					or recurring subscription in connection with an Application or as additional services. Such Paid Services may be
					provided solely by us or in collaboration with Application Developers, affiliates or business partners. You may be
					presented with additional terms related to a specific purchase before you confirm such transaction. Those additional
					terms will also govern that transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please note that if you enter into a transaction with a third-party, such as by purchasing an item through a Website
					hosted on the Sites, and have a dispute over the goods or services you purchased we have no liability for such goods
					or services. Although we may intervene in disputes between Users concerning payments, we have no obligation to do
					so.

       </a>
       14. Payments
      </h5>
      <p>
       You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with the Paid Services in a timely manner
					with a valid payment method. You authorize Webs to charge your credit card, charge card, debit card, PayPal, or
					financial institution account (herein "Payment Method") for all charges to your accounts with Webs. When you provide
					a Payment Method to us, you confirm that you are permitted to use that Payment Method. You also authorize us to
					collect and store it, along with other related transaction information. When you make a purchase, you authorize us
					(and our designated payment processor) to charge the full amount to the Payment Method you designate for the
					transaction. For Premium Services, we only offer recurring payments; therefore, you agree that Webs may
					automatically charge the fee to your Payment Method at the beginning of each recurring period. For example, if you
					choose a Premium Service with a monthly plan, you will be billed every month on the anniversary date of the date you
					clicked the "Purchase" button. Additionally, we may offer a pre-pay payment option for payment of Premium Services
					("Pre-Payment Plan"). If you opt for a Pre-Payment Plan, your Payment Method will be charged the then-current fee
					for that Premium Service at the commencement of each renewal period. To help insure continuity of services and as a
					courtesy for members, if your renewal comes up after the date of expiration on your credit card, we will
					automatically update the date before attempting a renewal.
      </p>
      <p>
       You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Webs
					may be shared by Webs with third parties, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purpose
					of checking credit, effecting payment to Webs and servicing your account.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you pay by credit or debit card we may obtain a pre-approval from the issuer of the card for an amount up to the
					amount of the purchase. We will bill your card at the time of purchase or shortly thereafter. If you cancel a
					transaction before completion, that pre-approval may result in your funds not otherwise being immediately available.
					If you pay by debit card and your payment results in an overdraft or other fee from your bank, you alone are
					responsible for that fee. You agree to pay Webs all charges incurred under your account for any Paid Service in
					which you or anyone else who uses your account (including children, family and friends) enroll in accordance with
					this Agreement and any applicable Paid Services terms. If your Payment Method fails or your account is past due, (a)
					you agree to pay all amounts due on your account upon demand and reimburse us for all reversals, charge-backs,
					claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability incurred by us (including costs and related expenses) that were
					caused by or arising out of payments that you authorized or accepted, (b) Webs may collect fees owed using other
					collection mechanisms (this includes charging other payment methods on file with us) and (c) Webs reserves the right
					to either suspend or terminate your Premium Services or your account with Webs, including deletion of your Website
					from the Sites. Except as may be set forth herein, any fees charged to your account are non-refundable. You agree to
					submit any disputes regarding any charge to your account in writing to Webs within thirty (30) days of such charge,
					otherwise such dispute will be waived and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge.

					to you. Therefore, when you purchase or receive credits, you do not own the credits; rather, you receive a limited
					right to use such credits in connection with certain features and services on the Sites, such as the purchase of
					additional storage. Please note that purchases of Webs Credits are non-refundable, and you may not transfer or sell
					your Webs Credits to anyone. We may change the purchase price for Webs Credits at any time as well as the way that
					you can use or transfer the credits. We also reserve the right to stop issuing Webs Credits. Webs Credits are not
					redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value from us unless we agree otherwise in writing. If you leave a
					balance of Webs Credits unused for prolonged period of time, we may redeem those credits by giving you item(s) from
					the Credit Shop in equal value. If your account is cancelled or disabled, you will lose any accumulated credits.

       You agree to comply with the license and restrictions applicable to each item of Content you post, copy, access, or

       <b>
        "A
					general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the
					time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the
					debtor."

       And, if you are not a California resident, you waive any applicable state statutes of a similar
					effect.

					should try to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of this
					Agreement remain in full force and effect. Your accounts are non-transferable. The parties are independent
					contractors with respect to each other. You may not delegate your duties under this Agreement or assign this

					penalties. This Agreement, including links to any third party Paid Service provider terms and conditions,
					constitutes the entire agreement between you and Webs and governs your use of the Sites, superseding any prior
					agreements (whether written or oral) between you and Webs regarding the subject matter hereof. The other Users of
					the Sites are intended third party beneficiaries of your obligations under this Agreement. A party will not be
					liable for non-performance or delay in performance (other than of obligations regarding payment of money) caused by
					any event reasonably beyond the control of such party including, but not limited to wars, hostilities, revolutions,
					riots, civil commotion, national emergency, epidemics, fire, flood, earthquake, force of nature, explosion, embargo,

      <p>
       Webs gathers and stores three types of information about users that are subject to our Privacy Policy:
      </p>
      <br>
      <ul class="privacy_list">
       <li>
        Information users provide to us:
        <br>
        These are voluntary submissions made when creating an account on Webs or through your use of the Services, such as your name, date of birth, location and email address provided during registration, Content posted, or payment information provided during purchases. Please understand that when you sign into Webs or post Content, your information is not anonymous to us.
        <br>
       </li>
       <li>
        Information we collect when you interact with Webs:
        <br>
        We keep track of the actions you take on Webs, such as adding a friend, adding an application, or posting Content. Also, when you access our Services, we may collect information about your access method (such as hardware and software attributes), location, IP address, and pages you visit. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies". (For more on cookies, please see the section "What are cookies?")
        <br>
       </li>
       <li>
        Information we receive from third parties:
        <br>
        We do not own or operate the third-party applications, user websites and other services offered that you may use or interact with through Webs (collectively, "Webs-enhanced" applications, websites and services). Whenever you visit, use or interact with a Webs-enhanced application, website or service, we will receive information from them, including information about actions you take and Content you post on that application, website or service.
       </li>
      </ul>

       <a name="whyGather">

       Why does Webs gather information about me?
      </h5>
      <p>
       Webs collects information in order to provide a safe, efficient and customized experience. This information allows us to better tailor our content to users' needs and to help us better understand the demographics of our audience. Webs may use some of this information for contacting you, customizing the content and advertising you view, improving our services, conducting research, and providing anonymous reporting for clients. We only collect personally identifiable information from you because you are voluntarily submitting the information to us in order to enjoy certain Services.
      </p>
      <h5>
       <a name="howGather">
       </a>
       How will Websites and Applications on Webs treat my information?
      </h5>
      <p>
       As mentioned above, we do not own or operate Webs-enhanced applications, websites and services. We take steps to ensure that providers of Webs-enhanced applications, websites and services use information that you share on Webs in a manner consistent with your privacy settings and the terms of this Privacy Policy, but we cannot guarantee that they will follow our rules. Please take the time to familiarize yourself with the privacy settings of your account, as well as the settings and policies of the applications, websites and services that you visit, add or use on Webs. Here are some specific things to remember:
      </p>
      <ul class="privacy_list2">
       <li>
        By visiting or becoming a Member of a Website on Webs, the Content and information you provide during the registration process (including your email address) and other interactions with the Website may be accessed by the Website Creator and their authorized representatives and administrators, as well as any Application Developer whose Applications run on that Website.
       </li>
       <li>
        By adding or using an Application or a service provided by one of our affiliates or business partners, the information you provide in the interactions with that Application or service may be accessed by the respective Application Developer, affiliate or business partner and their authorized representatives.
       </li>
       <li>
        Although certain categories of profile information (such as your birthdate) have privacy settings, others (such as your name, gender, profile photo, geographic region, list of friends, list of websites you have joined) are considered publicly available and have no privacy settings associated with them.
       </li>
       <li>
        Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings or privacy settings of the Website(s) or Application(s) you used, or it was copied or stored by other users.
       </li>
       <li>
        Certain types of communications you send to other users cannot be removed, such as messages.
       </li>
       <li>
        When you post information on a Website, that information is subject to that Website's privacy settings and privacy policy, which may change from time to time.
       </li>
       <li>
        Publicly available information may be accessed by everyone on the Internet, including third-party search engines that may index, cache and store that information.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       You should always review the policies of third party websites, applications and services to make sure you are comfortable with the ways in which they use information you share with them. Any information you share with them is at your own risk. If you find an application, website or service that violates our rules, you should report the violation to us using this
       <a href="file:///C:/report-abuse">

       What are cookies?
      </h5>
      <p>
       Webs may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. These cookies help us make Webs easier to use, to make our advertising better, and to protect both you and Webs. For example, a cookie may be used to store or "remember" your Member login information (but not your password) so that you are not required to manually log into the site at every visit. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use some of our Services.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our advertisers and partners may also set cookies through our Services. For more information, please see the section "What about third party advertisers and links?"

       What about third party advertisers and links?
      </h5>
      <p>
       In the course of serving advertisements on Webs, a third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Additionally, some links from Webs may lead to websites operated by other companies. While these websites and advertisements may be co-branded with our name or logo, they are not operated or maintained by us. We do not control these cookies and users of Webs Services should check the privacy policy of the relevant advertiser to understand whether and how it uses cookies. Webs is not responsible for websites operated by third parties that are linked to by any of our sites.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ads appearing on this website, Webs, and sites hosted by Webs may be delivered to you by Google Ad Manager, DoubleClick, or other advertising partners. Information about your visits to this site, such as the number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you.

       How secure is my information?
      </h5>
      <p>
       Webs uses commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural measures to safeguard personally identifiable information in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. We limit access to personal information about you to employees whom we believe reasonably need that information to provide support, products, or services to you or to fulfill their roles within our organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although we have established and maintain security procedures to protect your personally identifiable information, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you share your information. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We cannot ensure that information you share on Webs will not become publicly available. We are not responsible for third party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on Webs. You can reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong password, using different passwords for different services, and using up-to-date antivirus software.

      <p>
       Please report any security violations to us on this

      <p>
       Any Content uploaded or created using our Services and posted on a Website are by default hosted for the public and are thus publicly accessible unless explicitly protected by the Website Creator's optional password protection setting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please note that even if you do not publish links to Content or submit links to a search engine, individuals or search engines may discover and link to your Content by data-mining, guessing the address, spidering sites, or other methods. If you are concerned about the privacy or confidentiality of Content that you produce, please take all appropriate steps to ensure that sensitive materials are password-protected.

       How is information shared?
      </h5>
      <p>
       Webs will not share your personally identifiable information with others except as described herein with regards to sharing with Webs-enhanced applications, websites and services and in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is reasonably necessary to offer the Services, legally required, or permitted by you. For example, we may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the Services at a co-location facility for servers, to register your domain name, to send out email updates about Webs, to provide you with email functionality for your domain, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for products or services, or to provide search results or links (including sponsored links). In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to the Webs-specified purposes. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of Webs (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).
      </p>
      <p>
       Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose personal information to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is necessary: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process received by Webs, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (2) to enforce the Webs Terms of Service or to protect our rights; or (3) to protect the safety or rights of members of the public or users of the Services. Webs reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of Webs or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.

Similarly, any feed or stream published by your Application must have been clearly authorized and expected by the User. You must use discretion when publishing feeds or stream stories to prevent an excessive amount of such stories on a User's behalf.

      </h5>
      <p>
       Your license to the Webs IP under these Application Developer Terms continues until terminated by yourself or Webs. You may terminate the license and these Application Developer Terms by discontinuing use of the Webs IP.

If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."
      </p>
      <h5>
       14. Indemnification
      </h5>
      <p>
       In addition to the indemnification provisions in our Terms of Service, you hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Webs, its subsidiaries, affiliates, co-branders, all third-party advertisers, technology providers, service providers or other partners, and each of their respective officers, directors, agents, shareholders, employees and representatives, from any third-party claim, demand, loss, damage, cost, or liability (including reasonable attorney's fees) arising out of or relating to: (i) your breach or alleged breach of these Application Developer Terms; (ii) your use of or interaction with the Platform or Webs IP, (iii) your Application, (iv) your violation of any law, treaty, regulation or other governmental order, (v) your violation of the proprietary or other rights of third parties, or your use or misuse of any User data, including in violation of our
       <a href="file:///C:/terms-of-service#privacy">
        Privacy Policy
       </a>
       . Webs reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify Webs, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims. You agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent of Webs. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.
      </p>
      <h5>
       15. Confidentiality
      </h5>
      <p>
       Any code, material, data or other information relating to Webs (including, without limitation, our software, Platform, and Webs IP) that becomes known to you, whether orally, in writing, or by inspection of tangible objects, including technical data, research, product plans, or know-how, or otherwise, and that either is designated as confidential or that is not generally known or readily ascertainable to the public constitutes and contains proprietary and confidential information of Webs ("Confidential Information"). You may not disclose Confidential Information to any person other than your employees with a need to know such information or consultants under contract to you who have agreed in writing to be bound by confidentiality restrictions at least as protective of the Confidential Information as these Application Developer Terms. You may not use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than to exercise your rights under these Application Developer Terms. You shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and to avoid the unauthorized use and disclosure of the Confidential Information. You shall immediately notify Webs in the event you become aware of any unauthorized or suspected unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information. All Confidential Information remains the property of Webs, and no license or other right in any Confidential Information is granted hereby. Upon our written request, you will destroy or return to Webs all Confidential Information in your possession. In addition to the terms of this provision, you and Webs will continue to be subject to any non-disclosure agreement that you and Webs have entered into separately. This provision will survive any termination of these Application Developer Terms.
      </p>
      <h5>
       16. General
      </h5>
      <p>
       We can change these Application Developer Terms at any time without prior notice as we deem necessary. Your continued use of Platform constitutes acceptance of those changes. The failure of Webs to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should try to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of this Agreement remain in full force and effect. The parties are independent contractors with respect to each other. This Agreement does not constitute and shall not be construed as constituting a partnership or joint venture among the parties hereto, or an employee-employer relationship and you agree that Webs has no special relationship or fiduciary duty to you. You may not delegate your duties under this Agreement or assign this Agreement, in whole or in part. Webs may assign this Agreement in whole or in part in its sole discretion without your consent and without notice. Except for any mutually executed amendments hereto, this Agreement and our Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Webs and govern your use of the Services and Platform, superseding any prior agreements (whether written or oral) between you and Webs regarding the subject matter hereof. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent us from complying with the law and applicable regulations.

       What is webspam?
      </h1>
      <p>
       Webspam consists of web pages that are created with the intent of manipulating search engines algorithms for the
	purpose of unnaturally ranking a website or websites for specific keywords or search terms, often with the aim of
	monetary gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Webs takes spam and webspam seriously and will not tolerate spam or webspam in any of its forms. The following
	practices are NOT ALLOWED and are violations of Webs
        <a href="file:///C:/terms-of-service">
         Terms of Service
        </a>
        (ToS) agreement:
       </b>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <b>
         Content Spam:
        </b>
        Webs does not allow the populating of user sites or web pages with popular and monetizable search terms.
        <br>
       </li>
       <li>
        <b>
         Link Spam:
        </b>
        Webs does not allow the creation of links to a page solely or primarily in order to increase its link-based score.
        <br>
       </li>
       <li>
        <b>
         Automatically/Programmatically Generated Content:
        </b>
        Webs does not allow content that has been generated programmatically. Programmatic content consists of paragraphs of
	random text that makes no sense to the reader, but which may contain search keywords.
        <br>
       </li>
       <li>
        <b>
         Keyword stuffing:
        </b>
        Webs does not allow the promotion of sites that use keyword stuffing, a technique where web pages are loaded
	with keywords to inflate the site's ranking.
        <br>
       </li>
       <li>
        <b>
         Cloaking:
        </b>
        Webs does not allow the promotion of sites that use cloaking, a technique where different content is served
	to search engines than to users.
        <br>
       </li>
       <li>
        <b>
         Sneaky JavaScript redirects:
        </b>
        Webs does not allow the promotion of sites that use sneaky Javascript redirects. Sneaky redirects are designed to
	deceive search engines or to display different content to human users than to search engines. It's a violation
	of Webs Terms of Service agreement to use JavaScript, a meta refresh, or other technologies to redirect a user to a
	different page with the intent to show the user a different page than a search engine crawler sees.
        <br>
       </li>
       <li>
        <b>
         Doorway pages:
        </b>
        Webs does not allow the promotion of web pages that are created solely to rank high in search engine results for
	particular phrases, with the purpose of then sending users to a different page. In many cases, doorway pages are
	written to rank for a particular phrase and then funnel users to a single destination.
        <br>
       </li>
       <li>
        <b>
         Trademark Content:
        </b>
        Webs does not allow the use of others' trademarks in the name, domain, subdomain or in linked headers of your
	website.
        <br>
       </li>
       <li>
        <b>
         Hidden text or links:
        </b>
        Webs does not allow hiding text or links in your content to manipulate search engine rankings. This is considered
	deceptive and is a violation of Webs Terms of Service agreement.
        <br>
       </li>
       <li>
        <b>
         Link Schemes:
        </b>
        Webs does not allow any links intended to manipulate a site's ranking in a search results page. User sites employing
	this tactic will be considered part of a link scheme and will be suspended. This includes any behavior that
	manipulates links to your site, or outgoing links from your site. Manipulating these links may affect the quality of
	search results, and as such is a violation of the Webs Terms of Service agreement.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       When you sign up for a Webs account, you agree not to use the account to send spam, distribute viruses, or otherwise
	abuse the service. All users of Webs products, apps and services are subject to these agreements, which are part of
	the Webs Terms of Service agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Webs identifies a user who is violating this agreement, we reserve the right to immediately suspend the user. If
	the problem persists, we reserve the right to suspend the entire account and deny access to all the Webs products,
	apps and services. In such cases, we send a notification to the registered secondary email address for the website
	administrator.
