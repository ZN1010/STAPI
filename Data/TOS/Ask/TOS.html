         15. Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO
            FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS
       </p>
       <p>
        ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT; THE RULES, INCLUDING DISCOVERY ARE DIFFERENT AND NO JUDGE OR JURY IS
            PRESENT AT AN ARBITRATION. THE AWARD IS FINAL AND BINDING AND SUBJECT ONLY TO LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         a. General. Except as otherwise provided in this section 15, by using the Site and Services, you and Ask
                agree to submit any disputes arising from the use of the Site or Services or any interpretation,
                violation, non-performance, termination or invalidity of these Terms of Service or this arbitration
                provision (including questions of its formation and enforceability) to final and binding arbitration
                under the Commercial Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association, which can be found
                here, by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with those Rules. Notwithstanding these rules,
                however, such proceeding shall be governed by the laws of the state of California as set forth in
                section 14 above. You agree to submit to binding arbitration in either San Francisco, California or your
                county of residence. Ask will agree to commence arbitration in your county of residence. At your written
                request, Ask will consider any requests to advance or reimburse any arbitration filing fee, or
                administrative and hearing fees that you are required to pay to pursue a claim in arbitration. The
                arbitrator will decide who will ultimately be responsible for paying those fees. In no event will you be
                required to reimburse Ask for any arbitration filing, administrative, or hearing fees in an amount
                greater than what your court costs would have been if the claim had been resolved in court. Any award in
                an arbitration initiated under this clause shall be limited to monetary damages and shall include no
                injunction or direction to any party other than the direction to pay a monetary amount. Further, the
                arbitrator(s) shall have no authority to award punitive, consequential or other damages not measured by
                the prevailing party’s actual damages in any arbitration initiated under this section, except as may be
                required by statute.
        </li>
        <li>
         b. Class Action Waiver. Any proceedings to resolve any dispute will be conducted solely on an individual
                basis. Neither you nor Ask will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action, private attorney
                general action, or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a
                representative capacity. No arbitration proceeding may be combined with another without the prior

         c. NO RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL FOR ARBITRAL CLAIM. YOU AND ASK ALSO HEREBY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL
                FOR ANY ARBITRAL CLAIM. IF FOR ANY REASON THIS SECTION 15 IS HELD NOT TO APPLY TO AN ARBITRAL CLAIM,
                WHETHER SUCH ARBITRAL CLAIM IS AGAINST YOU, ASK, OR ASK INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, BOTH YOU AND ASK STILL
                AGREE TO WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY FOR THAT ARBITRAL CLAIM. BY USING THE SITE AND/OR SERVICES, YOU EXPRESSLY
                WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.

        <li>
         d. Exception. Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, this
                agreement does not preclude claims by Ask to enforce its intellectual property rights and/or remedy
                unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, unauthorized access, fraud or computer fraud,
                and/or industrial espionage. Neither party is precluded from seeking relief in a court located in San
                Francisco, for provisional remedies, including temporary restraining order, preliminary injunctions, and
                receiverships, pending arbitration or comprehensive litigation, to the extent authorized in this section
                15.
