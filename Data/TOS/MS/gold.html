However, you can choose to register an account with us after submitting your order. Please see our Privacy Policy to see how your personal information will be used and stored.</p>
<h2>Acceptance of your order</h2>
<p>Please note that completion of the online checkout process does not constitute our acceptance of your offer to purchase products or services from us. We will notify you by email as soon as possible to acknowledge that we have received and are processing your order. Our acceptance of your order will take place only when we take payment from you and despatch the product(s) or on commencement of the services that you ordered from us. Prior to despatch of the product(s), M&S has the right to decline an order for any reason, including legal and regulatory reasons.</p>
<p>The duration of our contract with you will start from when you receive the order despatch email and last until the last day of your right to cancel.</p>
<p>In relation to orders for flowers, plants and fruit baskets amendments and cancellations can be accepted until your order is prepared for despatch. Amendments can be made online through “Your Account” or by calling us on 0333 014 8000.</p>
<p>If we cannot supply you with the product or service you ordered, we will not process your order, inform you of this in writing (including email) and, if you have already paid for the product or service, refund you in full as soon as reasonably possible.</p>
<p>If the fulfilment of an order (or any aspect of it) would be illegal or unlawful, including by reason of breach of export controls or sanctions rules, M&S has the right to stop or cease to fulfil the order at any time, including after despatch of products and/or notification to you that the order has been received and is being processed.  You acknowledge that M&S shall incur no liability in such circumstances.</p>

We take full payment immediately for all products save for Christmas Food to Order, where we take an immediate deposit of 30 pounds or euros depending where you are and take the remainder of the payment on collection of the products.</p>
<p>All products ordered will remain the property of M&S until we have delivered the products to the address specified by you or they have been collected in store. If your payment is not received and you have already received the products you ordered from us, you must pay for or return those products to us in accordance with our reasonable return instructions and in the same condition that you received them at your own expense. If you do not do this within 30 days of the date on which we cancel your order, we may collect or arrange for collection of the products at your expense.

<p>Please note that certain products and services may be subject to alternative delivery charges, restrictions and/or timescales. In particular:</p>
<p>Furniture can only be delivered within the UK mainland and Northern Ireland and a signature will be required on receipt (orders for furniture to the Isle of Man may only be placed at our Douglas, Isle of Man store and a delivery charge of £100 per order is payable). We are unable to deliver furniture to the Orkney islands. Our Home Delivery company will contact you to book a delivery date within 2-3 days of your placing an order. If you postpone your delivery within 3 days of the agreed date a re-arrangement charge of £50 will apply. If you are unable to accept the delivery offered or you wish us to hold your order for a period of time, we can provide a storage service at a cost of £25 per week. Where we offer an assembly service (on certain furniture products) our crew must have normal ground floor access and the route and the room must be large enough to accommodate your order. If the product does not fit into your home, it will be classed as a cancelled order and costs will be incurred by you. The crew will ask you to inspect your items carefully before signing for delivery and any assembly. If you’re dissatisfied for any reason, please inform the crew. Where you have been offered our bed disposal service (whereby we remove and dispose of your old bed on delivery of your new bed) provision of this service is conditional upon the product having been disassembled prior to our collection and not being infested, wet or heavily soiled. Some furniture products will be delivered to your door and left packaged. For these items, delivery is arranged by phone. Some products may require self-assembly (instructions will be provided). These products are identifiable as you will be able to book delivery online.</p>
<p>Orders for flowers, plants and fruit baskets received by 6pm (1pm for fruit baskets) will be delivered the next day (except Sundays and bank holidays) to most UK addresses, Monday to Saturday 7.00am to 7.00pm (at peak times we may require orders to be place earlier). Amendments and cancellations may be accepted before your order is prepared for despatch. At peak times we may set final amendment dates. The earliest delivery date for orders placed on Sunday will be the following Tuesday. Deliveries to the Isle of Man, Northern Ireland and some Scottish addresses will take 48 hours and we are unable to deliver on Mondays. For these regions, orders placed on Sunday will be delivered on Wednesday. We cannot deliver flowers to British Forces Post Offices. Hospital deliveries are delivered to the reception or post room only and we cannot guarantee they will be accepted. Please check the hospital’s policy before placing your order.</p>
<p>Chilled hampers cannot be delivered to British Forces Post Offices, PO boxes, Scottish Highlands and Islands, Isle of Wight, Northern Ireland, Scilly Isles, Channel Islands or overseas. You must ensure that the recipient or another person will be available to take receipt of the delivery. We are unable to make a second delivery attempt due to the perishable nature of the component products.</p>
<p>Wine Club Subscriptions can be delivered to most UK addresses (excluding the Channel Islands) Monday to Saturday, 7.30am to 6pm. Deliveries to Isle of Man, Northern Ireland and some Scottish addresses will take 48 hours longer. We cannot deliver to PO Box addresses or BFPO boxes.</p>
<p>Delivery will be to the UK or international address or store specified in your order. If no one is available at a residential or other address at the time of delivery, a note will be left to advise whether your order has been left in a safe place e.g. with a neighbour, or returned to depot.</p>

Offer excludes wine, furniture, gift cards and Made to Measure shirts. The basket value is calculated inclusive of any other promotions.</p>

We’ll be in touch when your order is ready to be collected from your chosen store. Food orders can be collected anytime on your collection date. All other orders can be collected from 12pm.</p>
<h2>International Delivery</h2>
<p>Due to customs, legal, regulatory and certain practical restrictions applicable to orders placed for international delivery, some of our products may not be available for delivery to certain destinations outside the UK. M&S reserves the right to define what can and cannot be delivered to which destination.</p>
<p>Payment - Purchases will be made in Pounds Sterling. International credit card providers or banks will determine the exchange rate and may add an additional processing or administration charge in relation to such payment which international credit card holders will be liable to pay.</p>
<p>Marks & Spencer products are sold on a delivery duty unpaid basis. The recipient may have to pay import duty or a formal customs entry fee prior to or on delivery. Additional taxes, fees or levies may apply according to local legislation and customers are required to check these details before placing an order for international delivery.</p>
<p>Where applicable, it will be your sole responsibility to comply with any export controls or sanctions rules applicable to goods supplied to you.</p>
<p>You’ll find more information on international delivery, returns and refunds, and VAT delays in our help section .</p>
