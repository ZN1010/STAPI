         Acceptance of your order
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Please note that completion of the online checkout process does not constitute our acceptance of your offer to purchase products or services from us. We will notify you by email as soon as possible to&nbsp;acknowledge that we have received and are processing your order. Our acceptance of your order will take place only when we take payment from you and despatch the product(s) or on commencement of the services that you ordered from us. Prior to despatch of the product(s), M&amp;S has the right to decline an order for any reason, including legal and regulatory reasons.
       </p>
       <p>
        The duration of our contract with you will start from when you receive the order despatch email and last until the last day of your right to cancel.
       </p>
       <p>
        In relation to orders for flowers, plants and fruit baskets amendments and cancellations can be accepted until your order is prepared for despatch. Amendments can be made online through “Your Account” or by calling us on 0333 014 8000.
       </p>
       <p>
        If we cannot supply you with the product or service you ordered, we will not process your order, inform you of this in writing (including email) and, if you have already paid for the product or service, refund you in full as soon as reasonably possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the fulfilment of an order (or any aspect of it) would be illegal or unlawful, including by reason of breach of export controls or sanctions rules, M&amp;S has the right to stop or cease to fulfil the order at any time, including after despatch of products and/or notification to you that the order has been received and is being processed.&nbsp; You acknowledge that M&amp;S shall incur no liability in such circumstances.

       </p>
       <p>
        During the checkout process, you will be asked to enter your payment details. By completing your payment details you confirm that the credit or debit card being used is yours. All fields indicated as compulsory must be completed. Please note that we may collect and store your information, using an encrypted secure payment mechanism and will only use your information in accordance with our Privacy and Cookie Policy.
       </p>
       <p>
        All card payments are subject to authorisation by your card issuer. We take full payment immediately for all products save for Christmas Food to Order, where we take an immediate deposit of 30 pounds or euros depending where you are and take&nbsp;the remainder of the payment on collection of the products.
       </p>
       <p>
        All products ordered will remain the property of M&amp;S until we have delivered the products to the address specified by you or they have been collected in store. If your payment is not received and you have already received the products you ordered from us, you must pay for or return those products to us in accordance with our reasonable return instructions and in the same condition that you received them at your own expense. If you do not do this within 30 days of the date on which we cancel your order, we may collect or arrange for collection of the products at your expense. We reserve the right to charge you for any and all damage to (or other adverse interference with) any products that are the subject of an unpaid order.

         <strong>
          Furniture
         </strong>
         can only be delivered within the UK mainland and Northern Ireland and a signature will be required on receipt (orders for furniture to the Isle of Man may only be placed at our Douglas, Isle of Man store and a delivery charge of £100 per order is payable). We are unable to deliver furniture to the Orkney islands. Our Home Delivery company will contact you to book a delivery date within 2-3 days of your placing an order. If you postpone your delivery within 3&nbsp;days of the agreed date a re-arrangement charge of £50 will apply. If you are unable to accept the delivery offered or you wish us to hold your order for a period of time, we can provide a storage service at a cost of £25 per week. Where we offer an assembly service (on certain furniture products) our crew must have normal ground floor access and the route and the room must be large enough to accommodate your order. If the product does not fit into your home, it will be classed as a cancelled order and costs will be incurred by you. The crew will ask you to inspect your items carefully before signing for delivery and any assembly. If you’re dissatisfied for any reason, please inform the crew. Where you have been offered our bed disposal service (whereby we remove and dispose of your old bed on delivery of your new bed) provision of this service is conditional upon the product having been disassembled prior to our collection and not being infested, wet or heavily soiled. Some furniture products will be delivered to your door and left packaged. For these items, delivery is arranged by phone. Some products may require self-assembly (instructions will be provided). These products are identifiable as you will be able to book delivery online.

Amendments and cancellations&nbsp;may be accepted&nbsp;before your order is prepared for despatch. At peak times we may set final amendment dates. The earliest delivery date for orders placed on Sunday will be the following Tuesday. Deliveries to the Isle of Man, Northern Ireland and some Scottish addresses will take 48 hours and we are unable to deliver on Mondays. For these regions, orders placed on Sunday will be delivered on Wednesday. We cannot deliver flowers to British Forces Post Offices.

         International Delivery

        <br>
        <br>
        Payment - Purchases will be made in Pounds Sterling. International credit card providers or banks will determine the exchange rate and may add an additional processing or administration charge in relation to such payment which international credit card holders will be liable to pay.

        If you wish to cancel (or are considering cancelling) a product or service you have ordered from us, please be aware of the following terms that apply:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Applicability of cancellation rights: Statutory&nbsp;rights of cancellation under the Regulations&nbsp;available for UK or EU consumers do not apply to certain products and services (for example, made to measure orders, flowers, plants, fruit baskets, lingerie (for hygiene reasons), food, gifts and personalised items) or to any products with a seal where the seal is broken.
        </li>
        <li>
         Damaged or incorrectly supplied products: You should check all products you receive against your order. If the products you receive are damaged or incorrectly supplied on delivery then you must note the details of any damage or error in supply on the delivery documentation or if you are unable to view the items on receipt, you must inform us (by post, phone or email only) within a reasonable period of time. You must return the products to us as soon as possible after informing us that the products are damaged or have been incorrectly supplied.
        </li>
        <li>
         Damage during the course of returning products: If you choose to return any products to us, we will not be responsible for any loss or damage to them in transit and, for this reason, we recommend that you use a recorded delivery service. If returned products are lost or damaged in transit, we reserve the right to charge you (or not to refund any amounts attributable to) such loss or damage.
        </li>
        <li>
         Other cancelled products: If you want to cancel products that are not damaged or incorrectly supplied, then you must inform us of this within 14 calendar days after the day on which you received the goods or services in accordance with the Regulations&nbsp;or otherwise as soon as possible. You must take good&nbsp;care of the products that you wish to cancel. Products should be returned in or with their original packaging or in the case of furniture, collection arrangements made, promptly at your cost (currently a charge of £50) which will be notified to you at the time of cancellation.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        This is not intended to be a full statement of all your rights under the Regulations. Full details of your rights under the Regulations are available in the UK from your local Citizens’ Advice Bureau or your Local Authority’s Trading Standards Office.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the case of damaged or incorrectly supplied goods, we may offer you a replacement product. Any refunds given by us will be made to the debit/credit card account or by cheque (as applicable) &nbsp;provided when you placed your order and will be subject to our right to withhold amounts for products which are damaged on return or for which we arrange collection, as outlined above.
        <br>
        <br>
        Where we deliver products to a third party in accordance with your order, you will only be able to exercise this cancellation right if you can return the goods to us (or arrange for us to collect them).
        <br>
        <br>

         Liability
        </strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        There are certain liabilities which we cannot exclude by law and nothing in these General Terms and Conditions of Sale limits our liability for personal injury or death caused by our negligence or for fraud.
        <br>
        <br>
        You have certain rights as a consumer, including statutory rights relating to faulty or misdescribed goods. For further information about your statutory rights in the UK, contact your local authority Trading Standards Department or Citizen’s Advice Bureau. Nothing in these General Terms and Conditions of Sale will affect these statutory rights and, in particular, we will perform our obligations under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale with reasonable care and skill.
        <br>
        <br>
        Any products we supply to you will be of satisfactory quality. If we deliver a product to you that is not of satisfactory quality, you can contact us for a repair or replacement or, where this is not possible, for a refund.
        <br>
        <br>
        We are only responsible for losses that are a natural, foreseeable consequence of our breach of these General Terms and Conditions of Sale. We will not be liable to you if we are prevented or delayed from complying with our obligations under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale by anything you (or anyone acting on your behalf) does or fails to do or due to events which are beyond our reasonable control.
        <br>
        <br>
        You must follow any advice we give you to keep products we supply to you safe (including any instructions or product manuals provided with the products). We cannot accept liability for damage to products we have supplied which is caused by your failure to follow this advice.
        <br>
        <br>
        In any event we will not be liable for any losses related to any business of yours including (without limitation) lost data, lost profits, lost revenues or business interruption.

         Assignment, waiver and third party rights
        </strong>
        <br>
        <strong>
         <br>
        </strong>
        We may update or amend these General Terms and Conditions of Sale from time to time to comply with law or to meet our changing business requirements without notice to you. Any updates or amendments will be posted on the Website.
        <br>
        <br>
        You may not assign or sub-contract any of your rights or obligations under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale to any third party unless we agree in writing.
        <br>
        <br>
        We may assign, transfer or sub-contract any of our rights or obligations under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale to any third party at our discretion.
        <br>
        <br>
        No relaxation or delay by us in exercising any right or remedy under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale shall operate as waiver of that right or remedy or shall affect our ability to subsequently exercise that right or remedy. Any waiver must be agreed by us in writing.
        <br>
        <br>
        If any of these General Terms and Conditions of Sale are found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the rest of these General Terms and Conditions of Sale shall remain in full force and effect.
        <br>
        <br>
        Only you and we shall be entitled to enforce these Terms of Sale. No third party shall be entitled to enforce any of these Terms of Sale, whether by virtue of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 or otherwise.
        <br>
        <br>
        These General Terms and Conditions of Sale are governed by the laws of England and Wales and any disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.
