<p>This Privacy Policy describes how and when we collect, use, and share
 your information across our websites, SMS, APIs, email notifications, 
applications, buttons, embeds, ads, and&nbsp;<a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20172501#">our other covered services</a>&nbsp;that
 link to this Policy (collectively, the “Services”), and from our 
partners and other third parties. For example, you send us information 
when you use our Services on the web, via SMS, or from an application 
such as Twitter for Mac, Twitter for Android, or TweetDeck. When using 
any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, 
disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy 
Policy. This includes any information you choose to provide that is 
deemed sensitive under applicable law.</p>


<p>When this policy mentions “we” or “us,” it refers to the controller 
of your information under this policy. If you live in the United States,
 your information is controlled by Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market Street, 
Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103 U.S.A. If you live outside the United
 States, the data controller responsible for your information is Twitter
 International Company, an Irish company with its registered office at 
One Cumberland Place, Fenian Street, Dublin 2 D02 AX07 Ireland. Despite 
this, you alone control and are responsible for the posting of your 
Tweets and other content you submit through the Services, as provided in

<p>Irrespective of which country you live in, you authorize us to

    <div class="parbase text c02-rich-text-editor">

<p><b>Basic Account Information:</b>&nbsp;If you choose to create a 
Twitter account, you must provide us with some personal information, 
such as your name, username, password, email address, or phone number. 
On Twitter, your name and username are always listed publicly, including
 on your profile page and in search results, and you can use either your
 real name or a pseudonym. You can create and manage multiple Twitter 
accounts. If you use&nbsp;<a href="https://get.digits.com/">Digits by Twitter</a>,
 the contact information you provide to log in is not public.&nbsp;Some 
of our product features, such as searching and viewing public Twitter 
user profiles or watching a broadcast on Periscope’s website, do not 
require you to create an account.</p>


<p><b>Contact Information:</b>&nbsp;You may use your contact 
information, such as your email address or phone number, to customize 
your account or enable certain account features, for example, for<a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170388">&nbsp;login verification</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/14589#">Twitter via SMS</a>.
 If you provide us with your phone number, you agree to receive text 
messages to that number from us. We may use your contact information to 
send you information about our Services, to market to you, to help 
prevent spam, fraud, or abuse, and to help others find your account, 
including through third-party services and client applications. You may 
use your settings for&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/settings/notifications">email</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/settings/devices">mobile notifications</a>&nbsp;to
 control notifications you receive from Twitter. You may also 
unsubscribe from a notification by following the instructions contained 
within the notification or the instructions on our website. Your 
Discoverability&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/settings/safety">privacy settings</a>&nbsp;control whether others can find you on Twitter by your email address or phone number.</p>


<p><b>Additional Information:</b>&nbsp;You may choose to provide us with
 additional information to help improve and personalize your experience 
across our Services. For example, you may choose to upload and sync your
 address book so that we can help you find and connect with users you 
know or help other users find and connect with you. We may later 
personalize content, such as making suggestions or showing user accounts
 and Tweets for you and other users, based on imported address book 
contacts. You can delete your imported address book contacts at any time
 by visiting your Contacts Dashboard at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/settings/contacts_dashboard">https://twitter.com/settings/contacts_dashboard</a>.
 If you email us, we may keep your message, email address, and contact 
information to respond to your request. If you connect your account on 
our Services to your account on another service, the other service may 
send us information that you authorize for use in the Services. This 
information may enable cross-posting or otherwise help us improve the 
Services, and is deleted from our Services within a few weeks of your 
disconnecting from our Services your account on the other service.</p>


<p><b>Tweets, Following, Lists, Profile, and Other Public Information:&nbsp;</b>Twitter
 is primarily designed to help you share information with the world. 
Most of the information you provide us through Twitter is information 
you are asking us to make public. You may provide us with profile 
information such as a short biography, your location, your website, date
 of birth, or a picture. Additionally, your public information includes 
the messages you Tweet; the metadata provided with Tweets, such as when 
you Tweeted and the client application you used to Tweet; information 
about your account, such as creation time, language, country, and time 
zone; and the lists you create, people you follow, Tweets you Like or 
Retweet, and Periscope broadcasts you click or otherwise engage with 
(such as by commenting or hearting) on Twitter. Twitter broadly and 
instantly disseminates your public information to a wide range of users,
 customers, and services, including search engines, developers, and 
publishers that integrate Twitter content into their services, and 
organizations such as universities, public health agencies, and market 
research firms that analyze the information for trends and insights. 
When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via
 the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making 
public. We may use this information to make&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/your_twitter_data">inferences</a>,
 like what topics you may be interested in. Our default is almost always
 to make the information you provide through the Services public for as 
long as you do not delete it, but we generally give you&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/settings/safety">settings</a>&nbsp;or features, like&nbsp;<a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/14016#">protected Tweets</a>, to make the information more private if you want. For certain profile information fields we provide you with&nbsp;<a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20172733#">visibility settings</a>&nbsp;to
 select who can see this information in your profile. If you provide us 
with profile information and you don’t see a visibility setting, that 
information is public. You can change the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/119137#">language</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20169405#">time zone</a>&nbsp;associated with your account at any time using your account settings, available at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/settings/account">https://twitter.com/settings/account</a>.</p>

<p><b>Direct Messages and Non-Public Communications:</b>&nbsp;We provide
 certain features that allow you to communicate more privately. For 
example, you can use Direct Messages to have private conversations with 
other Twitter users. When you privately communicate with others through 
our Services, such as by sending and receiving Direct Messages, we will 
store and process your communications, and information related to them. 
Please note that if you interact with public Twitter content shared with
 you via Direct Message, for instance by liking a Tweet shared via 
Direct Message, those interactions may be public.&nbsp;When you use 
features like Direct Messages to communicate privately, please remember 
that recipients may copy, store, and re-share the contents of your 
communications.</p>


<p><b>Location Information:</b>&nbsp;We may receive information about 
your location. For example, you may choose to publish your location in 
your Tweets and in your Twitter profile. You may also tell us your 
location when you set your trend location on Twitter.com. We may also 
determine location by using other data from your device, such as precise
 location information from GPS, information about wireless networks or 
cell towers near your mobile device, or your IP address. We may use and 
store information about your location to provide features of our 
Services, such as allowing you to Tweet with your location, and to 
improve and customize the Services, for example, with more relevant 
content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to 
follow.&nbsp;Learn more about our use of location&nbsp;<a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/78525#">here</a>, and how to set your location preferences&nbsp;<a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/118492#">here</a>.</p>


<p><b>Links:</b>&nbsp;We may keep track of how you interact with links 
across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party 
services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through 
other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more 
relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics
 such as how many times a particular link was clicked on. Links, Tweets,
 and non-public communications like Direct Messages shared on the 
Services will be processed and links shortened to a&nbsp;<a href="http://t.co/">http://t.co</a>&nbsp;link.</p>


<p><b>Cookies:</b>&nbsp;Like many websites, we use cookies and similar 
technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our
 Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services 
such as searching and looking at public user profiles. A cookie is a 
small data file that is transferred to your computer or mobile device. 
We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better 
understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate 
usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to 
customize and improve our Services. Although most web browsers 
automatically accept cookies, some browsers’ settings can be modified to
 decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to place a 
cookie on your computer. However, some Services may not function 
properly if you disable cookies.&nbsp;You can control how we personalize
 your Twitter experience and ads by using your Personalization and Data 
settings, which are available at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/personalization">https://twitter.com/personalization</a>&nbsp;whether
 or not you have a Twitter account. We respond to these settings rather 
than the Do Not Track browser option, which we no longer 
support.&nbsp;Learn more about how we use cookies and similar 
technologies&nbsp;<a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170514#">here</a>.</p>


<p><b>Using Our Services:</b>&nbsp;We receive information when you view 
content on or otherwise interact with our Services, even if you have not
 created an account (“Log Data”). For example, when you visit our 
websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications,
 use your account to authenticate to a third-party website, application,
 or service, or visit a third-party website, application, or service 
that includes Twitter content, we may receive information about you. 
This Log Data may include your IP address, browser type, operating 
system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile 
carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), 
search terms, or cookie information. We also receive Log Data when you 
click on, view or interact with links on our Services, including links 
to third-party applications, such as when you choose to install another 
application through Twitter. We use Log Data to make inferences, like 
what topics you may be interested in, and to customize the content we 
show you, including ads. You can learn about the interests we have 
inferred about you from your activity on and off of Twitter in Your 
Twitter Data, available at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/your_twitter_data">https://twitter.com/your_twitter_data</a>.
 We keep Log Data as needed for the purposes described in this Privacy 
Policy. We will either delete Log Data or remove any common account 
identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, email address, or 
phone number, after a maximum of 18 months, if not sooner<a href="https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=en#tfw"></a>.</p>

<p><b style="font-family: inherit;font-style: inherit;">Twitter for Web Data:</b>&nbsp;We
 may personalize the Services for you based on your visits to 
third-party websites that integrate Twitter content such as embedded 
timelines or Tweet buttons. When you view our content on these websites,
 we may receive Log Data that includes the web page you visited. We 
never associate this web browsing history with your name, email address,
 phone number, or Twitter handle, and we delete, obfuscate, or aggregate
 it after no longer than 30 days. We may use interests or other 
information that we derive from this data to improve our Services and 
personalize content for you, such as suggestions for people to follow, 
advertising, and other content you may be interested in. You can see and
 control interests that we use to personalize your experience in Your 
Twitter Data, available at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/your_twitter_data" style="">https://twitter.com/your_twitter_data</a>.
 You can also control whether we keep track of your visits to websites 
with Twitter content by using your Personalization and Data settings, 
available at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/personalization" style="">https://twitter.com/personalization</a>.<br>
</p>


<p><b>Advertising:</b>&nbsp;Our Services are supported by advertising. 
We may use the information described in this Privacy Policy to help make
 our advertising more relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness, and
 to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of Twitter. 
We do not use the content you share privately in Direct Messages to 
serve you ads. Our Twitter Ads Policy also prohibits advertisers from 
targeting ads based on categories we consider&nbsp;<a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170368#">sensitive</a>,
 such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or health. Twitter adheres 
to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for 
Online Behavioral Advertising (also referred to as “interest-based 
advertising”). If you prefer, you can opt out of interest-based 
advertising by unchecking Personalize Ads in your Personalization and 
Data settings, available at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/personalization">https://twitter.com/personalization</a>&nbsp;or through the DAA’s consumer choice tool at&nbsp;<a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/">https://optout.aboutads.info</a>.
 We will not use information from the browser (and for logged in users, 
the account) on which you opt out for interest-based advertising, and 
that browser or account will not be eligible to receive interest-based 
ads from Twitter. Learn more about your privacy options for 
interest-based ads&nbsp;<a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170514#privacy-options">here</a>&nbsp;and about how ads work on our Services&nbsp;<a href="https://business.twitter.com/en/help/troubleshooting/how-twitter-ads-work.html">here</a>.</p>


<p><b>Third-Parties and Affiliates:</b>&nbsp;We may receive information 
about you from third parties, such as other Twitter users, partners 
(including ad partners), or our&nbsp;<a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20172501#">corporate affiliates</a>.
 For example, other users may share or disclose information about you, 
such as when they mention you, share a photo of you, or tag you in a 
photo. Your&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/settings/safety">privacy settings</a>&nbsp;control
 who can tag you in a photo. Our ad partners and affiliates may share 
information with us such as a browser cookie ID, mobile device ID, or 
cryptographic hash of an email address, as well as demographic or 
interest data and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. 
Our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, may enable us to collect 
similar information directly from their website or app by integrating 
our advertising technology.</p>


<p><b>Personalizing Across Your Devices:</b>&nbsp;When you log into your
 account with a browser or device, we will associate that browser or 
device with your account for purposes such as authentication and 
personalization. Depending on your settings, we may also personalize 
your experience on, and based on information from, other browsers or 
devices besides the ones you use to log into Twitter. For example, if 
you visit websites with sports content on your laptop, we may show you 
sports-related ads on Twitter for Android. You can control whether we 
link your account to browsers or devices other than the ones you use to 
log into Twitter (or if you’re logged out, whether we link the browser 
or device you’re currently using to any other devices) through your 
Personalization and Data settings, available at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/personalization">https://twitter.com/personalization</a>.</p>

<p><b>User Consent or Direction:</b>&nbsp;We may share or disclose your 
information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party 
web client or application to access your account or when you direct us 
to share your feedback with a business. When you use Digits by Twitter 
to sign up for or log in to a third-party application, you are directing
 us to share your contact information, such as your phone number, with 
that application. If you’ve shared information, like Direct Messages or 
protected Tweets, with another user who accesses Twitter through a 
third-party service, keep in mind that the information may be shared 
with the third-party service.</p>

<p><b>Service Providers:</b>&nbsp;We engage service providers to perform
 functions and provide services to us in the United States, Ireland, and
 other countries. For example, we use a variety of third-party services 
to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and 
wikis, and to help us understand and improve the use of our Services, 
such as Google Analytics. We may share your private personal information
 with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this
 Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security 
measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private 
personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions. We 
share your payment information, including your credit or debit card 
number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address with payment
 services providers to process payments; prevent, detect and investigate
 fraud or other prohibited activities; facilitate dispute resolution 
such as chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes associated with 
the acceptance of credit or debit cards.</p>


<p><b>Law and Harm:</b>&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
 this Privacy Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we
 believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, 
regulation,&nbsp;<a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/41949#">legal process, or governmental request</a>;
 to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or 
technical issues; or to protect our or our users’ rights or property. 
However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal 
defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a
 government’s, request to disclose your information.</p>


<p><b>Business Transfers and Affiliates:</b>&nbsp;In the event that we 
are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or 
sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of 
that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your information as 
transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose information about 
you to our&nbsp;<a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20172501">corporate affiliates</a>&nbsp;in
 order to help provide, understand, and improve our Services and our 
affiliates’ services, including the delivery of ads.</p>

<p><b>Public Information:</b>&nbsp;We may share or disclose your public 
information, such as your public user profile information, public 
Tweets, or the people you follow or that follow you. Remember: your 
privacy and visibility settings control whether your Tweets and certain 
profile information are made public. Other information, like your name 
and username, is always public on Twitter, unless you delete your 
account, as described below.</p>

<p><b style="font-family: inherit;font-style: inherit;">Non-Personal, Aggregated, or Device-Level Information:</b>&nbsp;We
 may share or disclose non-personal, aggregated, or device-level 
information such as the total number of times people engaged with a 
Tweet, the number of users who clicked on a particular link or voted on a
 poll in a Tweet (even if only one did), the characteristics of a device
 or its user when it is available to receive an ad, the topics that 
people are Tweeting about in a particular location, or aggregated or 
device-level reports to advertisers about users who saw or clicked on 
their ads. This information does not include your name, email address, 
phone number, or Twitter handle. We may, however, share non-personal,

<p>If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/account/settings">account settings</a>&nbsp;to
 access, correct, delete, or modify the personal information you 
provided to us and associated with your account. You can download 
certain account information, including your Tweets, by following the 
instructions&nbsp;<a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170160-downloading-your-twitter-archive">here</a>.&nbsp;You can learn more about the interests we have inferred about you in&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/your_twitter_data">Your Twitter Data</a>&nbsp;and request access to additional information&nbsp;<a href="https://support.twitter.com/forms/privacy">here</a>.</p>


<p>You can also permanently delete your Twitter account. If you follow the instructions&nbsp;<a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/15358-how-to-deactivate-your-account">here</a>,
 your account will be deactivated and then deleted.&nbsp;When 
deactivated, your account, including your name, username, and public 
profile, is not viewable on Twitter.com. For up to 30 days after 
deactivation it is still possible to restore your account if it was 
accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. Absent a separate arrangement 
between you and us to extend your deactivation period, after 30 days, we
 begin the process of deleting your account from our systems, which can 
take up to a week.</p>


<p>Keep in mind that search engines and other third parties may still 
retain copies of your public information, like your user profile 
information and public Tweets, even after you have deleted the 
information from the Twitter Services or deactivated your account. Learn
