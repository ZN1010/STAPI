</ol>

<p>A note about the Website and Services: some of our Services, data 
centers, service providers, affiliates or operating partners and servers
 may be located in other countries. As such, the Website and Services 
may be subject to the laws of numerous countries and jurisdictions, some
 of which may require us to disclose certain information about our 
users. We are committed to keeping your information private, while still
 complying with all applicable laws in jurisdiction in which we operate.</p>

<p>Should you have any concerns or believe that there are problems or 
issues relating to compliance with the policies outlined in this Privacy
 Policy, please notify us by e-mail at: legal@savefrom.net</p>

<p class="underline"><strong>A Word from SaveFrom</strong></p>

<p>SaveFrom has a strong commitment to providing superior service to all
 of our customers and visitors and particularly respecting their 
concerns about privacy. We understand that you may have questions about 
how the Website and Services collect and use your information. 
Accordingly, we prepared this statement to inform you of the privacy 
principles that govern the Website and Services (the <em class="bold">"Privacy Policy"</em>).
 We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information or a 
list of our customers to third parties. However, as described in more 
detail below, there are limited circumstances in which some of your 
information may be shared with third parties, under strict restrictions,
 so it is important for you to review this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy contains numerous general and technical details 
about the steps we take to respect your privacy. We have organized this 
Privacy Policy by major processes and areas so that you can quickly link
 to the information of most interest to you. The bottom line is that 
meeting your needs and expectations forms the foundation of everything 
we do, including protecting your privacy.</p>

<p class="underline"><strong>Changes in Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p>We want you to always be aware of what personal and other information
 we collect, how we use that information, and under what circumstances 
we may disclose it. All personal information that we collect will be 
handled according to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time the 
information is collected. If the Privacy Policy changes in any 
significant respect in the meantime, we will not (without your 
permission) use your personal data in a manner that is inconsistent with
 the Privacy Policy in effect at the time your information was 
collected.</p>

<p>From time to time, we may find the need to make changes to this 
Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may be amended by SaveFrom upon 
notice given through the Website or via e-mail. Please check the Privacy
 Policy published on this Website regularly to ensure that you are aware
 of all terms governing your use of this Website.</p>

<h2><strong>A. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></h2>

<p class="underline"><strong>Information We Collect Through the Website</strong></p>
<p>This Website does not collect personally identifiable information 
from your computer when you browse the Website and request pages from 
our servers. This means that, unless you voluntarily and knowingly 
provide us with personally identifiable information, we will not know 
your name, your e-mail address, or any other personally identifiable 
information.</p>

<p>When you request a page from our Website, our servers log the 
information provided in the HTTP request header, JavaScript or similar 
technical tools, including the IP number, the time of the request, the 
URL of your request and other information. We collect this information 
in order to make our Website function correctly and provide you the 
functionality that you see on the Website, as our servers use this 
information to deliver to you the pages on this Website. We also use 
this information to better understand how visitors use our Website and 
how we can better tune our Website, its contents and functionality to 
meet your needs. However, this information is not associated with any 
personally identifiable information of persons browsing the Website.</p>

<p>When you use the Website, SaveFrom or trusted third parties 
authorized by SaveFrom may also collect certain technical and routing 
information about your computer (also known as environmental variables) 
to facilitate your use of the Website and the Services enabled thereby. 
When you browse the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Mozilla 
Firefox, Google Chrome, or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically 
transmits some information to SaveFrom every time you access content on 
one of our internet domains. Examples of such information include the 
URL of the particular Web page you visited, the IP (Internet Protocol) 
address of the computer you are using, or the browser version that you 
are using to access the Website. All of this information may be 
collected by SaveFrom and used to help improve our offerings to you.</p>

<p class="underline"><strong>User Content</strong></p>

<p>Users may be permitted to upload certain content onto the Website and Services (<em class="bold">"User Content"</em>).
 This information shall be private and, except in accordance with this 
Privacy Policy, will not be disclosed to third parties without your 
prior permission.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, some of the data collected from you in
 connection with your use of this add-on/extension/app, as applicable, 
is shared or otherwise made available to third parties with whom we are 
affiliated or contracted with to provide analytical data and/or improve 
user experience, and is collected, stored and used in accordance with 
the third-party privacy policy set forth at: http://addons-privacy.com/</p>

<p class="underline"><strong>Providing Your Information to SaveFrom</strong></p>

<p>You never have to provide personally identifiable information to 
SaveFrom. However, should you choose to withhold certain required 
information, SaveFrom may not be able to provide you with some or all of
 the Services. Some of the information we ask you to provide may be 
identified as mandatory or optional. If you do not provide the mandatory
 information with respect to a particular activity, you may not be able 
to engage in that activity or make such a purchase. SaveFrom will inform
 you of the mandatory or optional nature of the requested or required 
information.</p>

<p>SaveFrom is the sole owner of the information it gathers on the 
Website and Services. SaveFrom will only share your information with 
outside parties in ways that are described in this privacy statement or 
if we are required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such
 action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law, 
cooperate with law enforcement agencies, or comply with a legal process 
served on us and the subsequent legislation adopted in the United 
States.</p>

<p>You may be provided an opportunity on the Website to allow SaveFrom 
to contact you from time to time regarding company news and product or 
Services updates. In order to do so, you may be required to provide 
certain personally identifiable information to SaveFrom. SaveFrom will 
treat this information in accordance with the policies set forth in this
 Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>When you submit personal information to SaveFrom through the Website,
 you understand and agree that this information may be transferred 
across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the
 countries in which SaveFrom and its affiliates and subsidiaries 
maintain offices. You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with
 respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage, 
and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors 
of SaveFrom. Such vendors are bound by contract not to use your personal
 information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties.</p>

<p>SaveFrom may establish relationships with various service providers 
whose services may become available to you from the Website or from 
other websites that are linked to the Website. Typically, these 
providers would offer services that SaveFrom customers might find 
useful, such as those that can be used in conjunction with the Website 
and Services. In order to use these services, you may be required to 
provide personal information to the services providers. Unless expressly
 provided to the contrary, personal information that you provide while 
you are visiting a provider's website will be subject to the privacy 
policy posted on such site, and personal information that you provide 
while on the Website in conjunction with a provider's service will be 
subject to this Privacy Policy. For instances, credit card information 
entered as part of the filling out the purchase form or registration 
process is collected by the third parties registration services and 
subject to their respective privacy policies. You should be aware that 
our agreements with these service providers often provide that they will
 share with SaveFrom personal information collected from you. In such 
instances, SaveFrom may use this information in a manner consistent with
 this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p class="underline"><strong>User Account</strong></p>

<p>Some of the Services offered to users of the Website require you to register for a user account with SaveFrom (<em class="bold">"User Account"</em>).
 When registering for a User Account, SaveFrom will ask you to 
voluntarily supply SaveFrom with certain information about yourself, 
such as your first and last name and e-mail address. You may also 
register with SaveFrom through your account with certain third party 
social networking services, including Facebook, VKontakte, Twitter 
and/or Odnoklassniki (collectively, <strong class="underline">"SNS"</strong>).</p>

<p>Please note that if you opt to use your SNS account to login to our 
Website and use our Services or interact with other user of the Website,

<p class="underline"><strong>Information Relating to Children</strong></p>

<p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) was passed by 
the U.S. Congress in November 1998. COPPA provides parents with specific
 rights regarding their children's privacy. For additional information 
and resources on COPPA, please visit the Federal Trade Commission Web 
site at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">http://www.ftc.gov/</a>. The 
SaveFrom Website and any Software or Services available on that site are
 not directed at children under 13 years of age and, therefore, COPPA 
does not apply. However, we recognize that children under the age of 13 
may access this Website and subscribe to the newsletter, purchase 
Software and Services, or download software programs. The collection of 
information is covered above. Parents and Legal Guardians may request 
from us to review, delete or stop the collection of the personally 
identifiable information of their child. You may do so by contacting us 
by letter or email to <a href="mailto:support@savefrom.net">support@savefrom.net</a>.</p>

<p class="underline"><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act Notice</strong></p>

<p>SaveFrom does not track users over time and across third party 
websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does use do not 
track (DNT) signals. However, some third party sites may keep track of 
your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them
 to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, 
your web browser may allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so 
that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be
 tracked.</p>

<p>SaveFrom does not authorize the collection of personally identifiable
 information by third parties and third parties cannot collect this 
information unless you provide it to them directly.</p>

<p class="underline"><strong>Cookies and Web Beacons</strong></p>

<p>The Website uses "cookie" and "web beacon" technology. "Cookies" are 
short pieces of data generated by a web server that a website stores on a
 user's computer. Certain pages on our Website may require the use of a 
cookie for purposes of keeping information you enter on multiple pages 
together. Cookies also enable us to customize our Website and offerings 
to your needs and provide you with a better online experience with us. 
In addition, cookies are used to:</p>

<ul>
<li>measure usage of various pages on our Website to help us make our 
information; more pertinent to your needs and easy for you to access;</li>

<li>identify and categorized the internet webpages from which the visitor came to the Website and observe the browsing patterns; and</li>

<li>provide functionality such as online orders, SaveFrom services and 
other functionality that we believe would be of interest and value to 
you.</li>
</ul>

<p>The types of cookies that we use are referred to as "session" cookies
 and "persistent" cookies. Session cookies are temporary and are 
automatically deleted once you leave the Website. Persistent cookies 
remain on your computer hard drive until you delete them. We do not use 
cookies to gather information concerning your visits to other websites, 
nor ascertain any personally identifiable information about you apart 
from what you voluntarily provide us in your dealings with SaveFrom. 
Cookies do not, under ordinary circumstances, corrupt or damage your 
computer, programs, or computer files.</p>

<p>In addition, the service providers we use to serve and host our 
advertisements, and/or deliver our e-mails use session and persistent 
cookies, to track the number of times the Website is accessed and 
whether the site was accessed from an advertisement. There are no 
cookies in the advertisements or e-mails. A cookie is placed on your 
computer only if and when you click on an advertisement or open the 
e-mail. The cookie generated from the advertisement or e-mail does not 
contain any personally identifiable information and will remain on your 
hard drive until you delete it.</p>

<p>You may set your browser to block cookies (consult the instructions 
for your particular browser on how to do this), although doing so may 
adversely affect your ability to perform certain transactions, use 
certain functionality and access certain content on our Website.</p>

<p>Web beacons are used in combination with cookies to help website 
operators understand how visitors interact with their websites. A web 
beacon is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 
pixel) that is placed on a site. As opposed to cookies, which are stored
 on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on 
Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this 
sentence. These web beacons are not tied to personally identifiable 
information. The use of a web beacons allows the site to measure the 
actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the web beacon. It
 makes it easier to follow and record the activities of a recognized 
browser, such as the path of pages visited at a website. SaveFrom uses 
the information provided by web beacons to develop a better 
understanding of how the Website's visitors use the Website, and to 
facilitate those visitors' interactions with the Website. SaveFrom may 
make the aggregate data obtained from web analytics (including from our 
third party analytics providers, if applicable) publicly available. If 
this data is made available, none of the information will be personally 
identifying information or potentially-personally identifying 
information.</p>

<h2><strong>B. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</strong></h2>

<p class="underline"><strong>How Your Personal Information is Used</strong></p>

<p>SaveFrom collects information from you in order to record and support
 your participation in the activities provided by SaveFrom. We may use 
your e-mail address to send a confirmation e-mail when you sign up for a
 User Account and, if necessary, may use other information you provide 
to contact you for help to process the purchase or service you have 
selected. Your personal information also may be used to keep you 
informed about new services, service upgrades, special offers, and other
 Services.</p>

<p>As described above, SaveFrom may collect information about your use 
of the Website and Services. This information is collected in aggregate 
form, without identifying any user individually. SaveFrom may use this 
aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for statistical analysis, 
marketing, or similar promotional purposes.</p>

<p>SaveFrom recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use
 of information collected on this Website. Without your consent, 
SaveFrom will not communicate any information to you regarding the 
Website, Services, or special offers available from SaveFrom or its 
affiliates, although we may find it necessary to communicate with you 
regarding your use of the Website, or Services in certain limited 
circumstances. Except in the particular circumstances described in this 
Privacy Policy, SaveFrom will also not provide your name to other 
companies or organizations without your consent.</p>

<p class="underline"><strong>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</strong></p>

<p>Although we will always strive to guard your identity, we may 
disclose your personally identifiable information without your 
permission in limited circumstances. We will only do so if we have a 
good-faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) comply 
with laws, regulations, or government requests or (2) to investigate or 
protect against harmful activities to our guests, visitors, associates, 
or property (including the Website or Services), or to others. If we are
 required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide your 
personally identifiable information, we will only do so upon receipt of 
appropriate documentation. We may also disclose your information to 
investigate violation of and enforce our Terms of Service. Please know 
that we do not take this responsibility lightly. Your privacy is of 
paramount importance to us.</p>

<p>SaveFrom does use the services of third parties, such as e-mail 
service providers, purchase, shipping and order processing merchants and
 marketing companies that act as independent contractors on behalf of 
SaveFrom. These parties are contractually prohibited from using 
personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for the 
purpose SaveFrom specifies. We do provide non-personally identifiable 
information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated 
basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us.
 We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information to entities 
outside of the SaveFrom's affiliates for their use without your 
approval.</p>

<p>In the event that all or substantially all of SaveFrom's stock and/or
 all or substantially all assets are transferred or sold to another 
entity, SaveFrom may transfer personally identifiable information to the
 acquiring entity. If, as a result of such a business transition, your 
personally identifiable information will be used in a materially 
different manner, you will be given choice consistent with our policy 
regarding notification of changes.</p>

<p class="underline"><strong>Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information</strong></p>

<p>SaveFrom operates secure data networks protected by industry standard
 firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy 
policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only 
authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our 
users. SaveFrom takes steps to ensure that your information is treated 
securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no 
data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure. As a 
result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot 
guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or from the
 Website or Services. Your use of the Website and Services is at your 
own risk.</p>

<p>We treat the information you provide to us as confidential 
information; it is, accordingly, subject to our company's security 
procedures and corporate policies regarding protection and use of 
confidential information. After personally identifiable information 
reaches SaveFrom it is stored on a server with physical and electronic 
security features as customary in the industry, including utilization of
 login/password procedures and electronic firewalls designed to block 
unauthorized access from outside of SaveFrom. Because laws applicable to
 personal information vary by country, our offices or other business 
operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on 
the applicable legal requirements. Information collected on the sites 
covered by this Privacy Policy is processed and stored in the United 
States and possibly other jurisdictions and also in other countries 
where SaveFrom and its service providers conduct business. All SaveFrom 
employees are aware of our privacy and security policies. Your 
information is only accessible to those employees who need it in order 
to perform their jobs.</p>

<h2><strong>C. CHOICES AVAILABLE TO YOU</strong></h2>

<p>You can always choose whether or not to disclose personally 
identifiable information and that choice will not prevent you from using
 the Website. Please note, however, if you should choose to withhold 
requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of 
the Services dependent upon the collection of this information and you 
will be given an opportunity to "opt-in" and make your preference 
choices for any items that are optional and which are not prerequisite 
for our rendering such Services.</p>

<p>You can choose at any time to opt out of receiving emails from 
SaveFrom by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email you
 receive from SaveFrom or by contacting SaveFrom directly at: <a href="mailto:support@savefrom.net">support@savefrom.net</a>
 . If you elect to opt out, we will not, as applicable, share your 
personal information with third parties or send you emails. However, we 
may continue to use your personal information for internal purposes, to 
enhance your user experience or as necessary to administer the site or 
comply with applicable law.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to send a one-time registration confirmation 
email, and infrequent service alert messages to users to inform you of 
specific changes that may impact your ability to use a service that you 
have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in 
status. We also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so 
as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of any 
applicable licensing, warranty and purchase agreements.</p>

<p>SaveFrom is retaining these rights because in limited cases we feel 
that we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or 
regarding matters that will be important to you. These rights do not 
allow us to contact you to market a new or existing Service if you have 
asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications is 
rare.</p>

<p><span>If you wish to opt out of receiving emails, the sharing or 
retention of any personal identification information, or otherwise 
change your personal preferences, you must contact SaveFrom at <a href="mailto:support@savefrom.net">support@savefrom.net</a>.</span></p>

<p>To ensure that your request is honored, you must provide SaveFrom 
with information sufficient for us to accurately identify and access 
your records. The information we require is your full name, address and 
the email address you provided to SaveFrom when you requested Services 
or Software. SaveFrom reserves the right to contact you to verify that 
we have accurately identified your record.</p>

<h2><strong>D. PRIVACY-RELATED INQUIRIES AND COMPLAINTS</strong></h2>

<p>SaveFrom takes and addresses its users' privacy concerns with utmost 
respect and attention. If you believe that there was an instance of 
non-compliance with this Privacy Policy with regard to your personal 
information or you have other related inquiries or concerns, you may 
write or contact SaveFrom at email: <a href="mailto:support@savefrom.net">support@savefrom.net</a>.</p>

<p>In your message, please describe in as much detail as possible the 
nature of your inquiry or the ways in which you believe that the 
SaveFrom Online Privacy Policy has not been complied with. We will 
investigate your inquiry or complaint promptly.</p>

<p>Please note that if you provide SaveFrom with inconsistent privacy 
preferences (for example, by indicating on one occasion that third 
parties may contact you with marketing offers and indicating on another 
occasion that they may not), SaveFrom cannot guarantee that your most 
recent privacy preference will be honored.</p>
