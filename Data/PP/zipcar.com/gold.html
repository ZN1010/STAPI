<h2>what personal information we collect and how we use it</h2>
<p>The principal purposes for which we collect and store your personal and financial information are to process your application, allow you to reserve and use our vehicles, authorize payment, bill you, respond to your inquiries, improve and communicate with you about our products and services and maintain your account with us.</p>
<p>Zipcar collects information that you voluntarily submit to us, which could include your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, or a picture of you or identifying documents. This also includes information in your profile, or information you provide to us via an email, text or similar message, telephone call, or by other means. Your telephone calls and other communications with us are usually recorded or monitored for quality control, training and similar purposes. By using these communication methods you are consenting to receiving information via these methods and the recording or monitoring of your calls and communications with Zipcar.</p>
<p>If you apply to join Zipcar, we collect information such as personal and financial information as you proceed through the stages of our application process, membership agreement and reservation process. In addition to your name and contact information, we will also collect your driver's license number and the jurisdiction in which you are licensed, credit card or other payment information, and other identifying information. We may also collect information such as your driving record from you, from regulatory bodies where you live, or from third parties. We use this information to process your application and for the purposes described below. Additionally, we may also use this information to detect and deter fraud, theft, or abuse of our service.</p>
<p>If you join Zipcar and use our services, we collect information about your searches for vehicles, reservations (dates, times, locations, etc.) and, your use of the Zipcar service (return time, mileage, accidents, etc.). We may also collect precise location if you enable location-based services on your mobile device. We use this information to provide and optimize services for you, including for example, billing you, responding to your inquiries, providing and improving our products and services, maintaining your account with us, personalizing your Zipcar experience (e.g., by understanding your preferences), and providing content and promotional offers. To learn more about how Zipcar customizes content and offers please see "Advertising and Personalized Content" below. From time to time, we may send marketing or other communications. To edit your preferences, please go to your account settings page.</p>
<p>Zipcars are equipped with vehicle tracking and anti-theft technology that uses Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS is a network of satellites that allows us to determine the location (latitude and longitude) of Zipcars during your reservation. Additionally, Zipcars also have an on-board device that may monitor the state of the vehicle from moment to moment whether or not in a reservation, and the information may include its location and driver behavior monitoring such as crash detection factors or rate of braking or acceleration. This information is transmitted to Zipcar and stored. Zipcar uses this information for a variety of important purposes. For example, we may monitor or store vehicle or GPS data to help you find a car you have reserved, to assist with roadside assistance, to assist in making a car available at the place and time you have reserved, to improve our service, to assist us in enforcing our legal rights, or to locate lost or stolen Zipcars.</p>

We may then send your friend one or more messages inviting your friend to join Zipcar. Zipcar stores this information for the purpose of sending these communications and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at privacy@zipcar.com to request that we no longer communicate send them refer a friend messages or other messages from Zipcar.</p>

Please note that the laws governing the processing of personal information in the United States of America may not be the same as they are in your home country.

If you apply for Zipcar membership, some of the information you supply may be shared with regulatory bodies and/or service providers we utilize to obtain your driving record or other personal information. In addition, if you are associated or affiliated with another primary account (for example, if you are an associate member or affiliated with a business's or university's account or discount plan), the primary account holder (such as a business or university) will generally have access to certain information regarding your account or your use of our services, including specific reservation details.</p>

Each independent licensee may collect personal information and use the personal information for its own purposes. Zipcar does not control the independent licensee's use of personal information.

In this case, the independent licensee is subject to the merchant rules of the credit card processors it selects. This privacy notice also does not apply to any independent licensee's website.
