<h2>The Information We Collect</h2>
<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Uber collects:</p>
<p>Information that you provide to Uber, such as when you create your Uber account.</p>
<p>Information created when you use our services, such as location, usage and device information.</p>
<p>Information from other sources, such as Uber partners and third parties that use Uber’s API.</p>
<p>Uber collects the following categories of information:</p>
<h2>Information you provide</h2>
<p>This includes information submitted when you:</p>
<p>Create or update your Uber account, which depending on your location and the Uber services you use may include your name, email, phone number, login name and password, address, payment or banking information, government identification numbers, birth date, and photo</p>
<p>Submit information about your vehicle or insurance (for driver partners)</p>
<p>Consent to a background check (for driver partners where permitted by law)</p>
<p>Request services through an Uber app or website</p>
<p>Contact Uber, including for customer support</p>
<p>Contact other Uber users through our services</p>
<p>Complete surveys sent to you by Uber or on behalf of Uber</p>
<p>Enable features that require Uber's access to your address book or calendar</p>
<h2>Information created when you use our services</h2>
<p>This includes:</p>
<h2>Location Information</h2>
<p>Depending on the Uber services that you use, and your app settings or device permissions, Uber may collect your precise or approximate location information as determined through data such as GPS, IP address and WiFi.</p>
<p>If you are a driver or delivery partner, Uber collects location information when the Uber app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) or background (app open but not on screen) of your device.</p>
<p>If you are a rider, Uber may collect location information when the Uber app is running in the foreground. In certain regions, Uber may also collect this information when the Uber app is running in the background of your device if this collection is enabled through your app settings or device permissions.</p>
<p>Riders and delivery recipients may use the Uber app without enabling Uber to collect their location information. However, this may affect the functionality available on your Uber app. For example, if you do not enable Uber to collect your location information, you will have to manually enter your pickup address. In addition, location information will be collected from the driver partner during your trip, even if you have not enabled Uber to collect your location information.</p>
<h2>Transaction Information</h2>
<p>We collect transaction details related to your use of our services, including the type of services you requested or provided, date and time the service was provided, amount charged, distance traveled, and other related transaction details. Additionally, if someone uses your promotion code, we may associate your name with that person.</p>
<h2>Usage and Preference Information</h2>
<p>We collect information about how you interact with our services, preferences expressed, and settings chosen. In some cases we do this through the use of cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies that create and maintain unique identifiers. To learn more about these technologies, please see our Cookie Statement.</p>
<h2>Device Information</h2>
<p>We may collect information about the devices you use to access our services, including the hardware models, operating systems and versions, software, file names and versions, preferred languages, unique device identifiers, advertising identifiers, serial numbers, device motion information, and mobile network information.</p>
<h2>Log Information</h2>
<p>When you interact with our services, we collect server logs, which may include information like device IP address, access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, app crashes and other system activity, type of browser, and the third-party site or service you were using before interacting with our services.</p>
<h2>Calls and text messages</h2>
<p>We enable users to call or text each other through the Uber apps. For example, in some countries, we enable driver partners and riders, and delivery partners and recipients, to call or text each other without disclosing their telephone numbers. To provide this service, Uber receives some information regarding the calls or texts, including the date and time of the call/text, and the content of the text messages. Uber may also use this information for customer support services (including to resolve disputes between users), for safety and security purposes, and for analytics.</p>
<h2>Address book and calendar information</h2>
<p>If you permit the Uber app to access the address book on your device, we may collect names and contact information from your address book to facilitate social interactions through our services and for other purposes described in this policy or at the time of consent or collection. If you permit the Uber app to access the calendar on your device, we collect calendar information such as event title and description, your response (Yes, No, Maybe), date and time, location, and number of attendees.</p>
<h2>Information from other sources</h2>
<p>These may include:</p>
<p>Users providing feedback, such as as ratings or compliments</p>
<p>Uber business partners through which you create or access your Uber account, such as payment providers, social media services, on-demand music services, or apps or websites who use Uber's APIs or whose API Uber uses</p>

<p>Uber uses the information it collects for purposes including:</p>
<h2>Providing services and features</h2>
<p>Uber uses the information we collect to provide, personalize, maintain and improve our products and services. This includes using the information to:</p>

<h2>Communications among users</h2>
<p>Uber uses the information we collect to enable communications between our users. For example, a driver partner may text or call a rider to confirm a pickup location, or a restaurant or delivery partner may call a delivery recipient with information about their order.</p>
<h2>Communications from Uber</h2>
<p>Uber may use the information we collect to communicate with you about products, services, promotions, studies, surveys, news, updates and events.

<h2>Information Sharing And Disclosure</h2>

<p>Uber may share the information we collect:</p>
<h2>With other users</h2>
<p>For example, if you are a rider, we may share your first name, average rider rating given by driver partners, and pickup and/or dropoff locations with driver partners. If you share an uberPOOL with another rider, that rider may be told your name and may see your pickup and/or dropoff location.</p>
<p>If you are a driver or delivery partner, we may share information with your rider(s) including your name and photo; your vehicle make, model, color, license plate, and vehicle photo; your location; your average rating provided by riders; and contact information (depending upon applicable laws).

The rider/delivery recipient will also receive a receipt containing information such as a breakdown of amounts charged, your first name, photo, a map of the route you took, and other transaction details.</p>
<h2>At your request</h2>
<p>This includes sharing your information with:</p>
<p>Other people at your request. For example, we may share your ETA and location with a friend at your request, or your trip information when you split a fare with a friend.</p>
<p>Uber business partners. For example, if you requested a service through a partnership or promotional offering made by a third party, Uber may share your information with those third parties. This may include, for example, other apps or websites that integrate with our APIs or services, or those with an API or service with which we integrate, or business partners with whom Uber may partner with to deliver a promotion, a contest or a specialized service.</p>
<h2>With the general public when you submit content to a public forum</h2>
<p>We love hearing from our users -- including through public forums such as Uber blogs, social media, and certain features on our network. When you communicate with us through those channels, your communications may be viewable by the public.</p>
<h2>With the owner of Uber accounts that you may use</h2>
<p>If you use a profile associated with another party we may share your trip information with the owner of that profile profile. This occurs, for example, if you are:</p>
<p>A rider using your employer's Uber for Business profile</p>
<p>A driver partner using an account owned by a partner transportation company</p>
<p>A rider who takes a trip arranged by a friend or under a Family Profile</p>
<h2>With Uber subsidiaries and affiliates</h2>
<p>We share information with our subsidiaries and affiliates to help us provide our services or conduct data processing on our behalf. For example, Uber may process or store information in the United States on behalf of its international subsidiaries and affiliates.</p>
<h2>With Uber service providers and business partners</h2>
<p>Uber may provide information to its vendors, consultants, marketing partners, research firms, and other service providers or business partners. For example, Uber may provide information to such parties to help facilitate insurance coverage, to conduct surveys on our behalf, and to process payments for our services.</p>
<h2>For legal reasons or in the event of a dispute</h2>
<p>Uber may share your information if we believe it is required by applicable law, regulation, operating agreement, legal process or governmental request.</p>

If you use another person's credit card, we may be required by law to share information with that credit card holder, including trip information.</p>

<h2>Information Retention And Deletion</h2>

<h2>Choice And Transparency</h2>
<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Uber provides means for you to see and control the information that Uber collects, including through:</p>
<p>In-app privacy settings</p>
<p>Device permissions</p>
<p>In-app ratings pages</p>

<h2>Privacy Settings</h2>
<p>The Privacy Settings menu in the Uber rider app gives users the the ability to set or update their location and contacts sharing preferences, and their preferences for receiving mobile notifications from Uber. Riders can also delete their Uber account from the Privacy Settings menu.</p>
<h2>Device Permissions</h2>
<p>Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without your consent. And these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. The iOS platform will alert you the first time the Uber app wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the permissions that the Uber app seeks before you first use the app, and your use of the app constitutes your consent.</p>
<h2>Ratings Look-Up</h2>
<p>After every trip, driver partners and riders are able to rate each other, as well as give feedback on how the trip went. This two-way system holds everyone accountable for their behavior. Accountability helps create a respectful, safe environment for both driver partners and riders. Your rider rating is available in the main menu of the Uber rider app. Your driver partner rating is available in the Ratings tab of the Uber Partner app.</p>
<h2>Accessing and Correcting Your Information</h2>
<p>You can edit the name, phone number and email address associated with your account through the Settings menu in Uber's apps. You can also look up your trips, orders and deliveries history in the Uber apps. You may also request access to, correction of, or a copy of your information by contacting Uber at help.uber.com or visiting our Privacy Policy Help Page.</p>
<h2>Marketing Opt-Outs</h2>
<p>You may opt out of receiving promotional emails from Uber here. You may also opt out of receiving emails and other messages from Uber by following the instructions in those messages. Please note that if you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional messages, such as receipts for your rides or information about your account.</p>
<h2>Updates To This Policy</h2>
<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
<p>We may occasionally update this policy. If you use our services after an update, you consent to the updated policy.</p>
<p>We may occasionally update this policy. If we make significant changes, we will notify you of the changes through the Uber apps or through others means, such as email.
