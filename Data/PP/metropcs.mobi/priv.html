<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the event that the terms and conditions relating to a feature you

with the MetroPCS Terms and Conditions of Service, your Rate Plan shall 
control. You accept our Terms and Conditions by doing any of the 
following (a) giving us a written or electronic signature or telling us 
orally that you accept the MetroPCS Terms and Conditions of Service; (b)
 activating Service (if you are a new subscriber); (c) using your

addition to your Service; (d) paying for the Service; or (e) failing to 
activate Service within 30 days after the purchase of your MetroPCS 
wireless device.&nbsp; You also agree to the terms and conditions of

may be included in your Rate Plan.&nbsp; By accepting the MetroPCS Terms
 and Conditions of Service, you agree to the following (see full

taxes and regulatory fees even if your rate plan is inclusive of taxes 
and regulatory fees.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MetroPCS may 
terminate your Service if you fail to timely pay for your Service or 
violate the Terms and Conditions of Service in any way, including abuse 
of the Service or violations of applicable laws.</p>
<p><b><u>MetroPCS Terms and Conditions of Service</u></b></p>
<p>Revised: June 2, 2017</p>
<p>When you initiate Service with MetroPCS, you may receive a Start of 
Service form and this Agreement. These materials, including applicable 
supplemental terms and conditions, and your Rate Plan terms, are part of
 your Agreement with MetroPCS (collectively, the “Agreement”). This 
Agreement governs the sale, use, and delivery of MetroPCS wireless 
services ("Service" or "Services") to you (the purchaser or user of the 
Services) by T-Mobile USA, Inc. and any of its controlled subsidiaries, 
assignees, and agents ("us," "we," "our" or "MetroPCS"). Certain other 
laws may also govern our provision of Services to you and such laws are 
incorporated in their entirety by this reference into this Agreement as 
if set forth in this Agreement. Your Service is also subject to, and you
 agree to adhere to, our business policies, practices, and procedures, 
which we can change at any time without notice to you (collectively, the
 "Policies"). Offers may not be available everywhere or combinable with 
other promotions/options. Your Rate Plan includes your allotments for 
minutes, messages or data, rates, coverage and other terms (“Rate 
Plan”). The Agreement makes up the complete agreement between you and 
us, and supersedes any and all prior and contemporaneous agreements, 
arrangements, representations, advertising, contracts, statements, 
offers, and understandings relating to the subject matter of the 
Agreement, whether oral or written, including, but not limited to, all 
previous versions of the Terms and Conditions of Service. You cannot 
rely on any other documents or statements by any sales person, service 
representative or other agent. You acknowledge and agree that you have 
not relied on any representation, assertion, guarantee, warranty, 
contract or other assurance, stated or made by anyone except those set 
out in this Agreement.</p>
<p><b><u>IMPORTANT</u>: READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. IT REQUIRES THE 
USE OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS 
TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. ARBITRATION IS MORE INFORMAL THAN LITIGATION 
BECAUSE IT USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY AND 
ALLOWS FOR LESS DISCOVERY AND LESS APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN COURT.</b></p>
<p><b>1.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Acceptance.</b>&nbsp;YOUR AGREEMENT WITH 
METROPCS STARTS WHEN YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. YOU AGREE TO
 COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND POLICIES BY DOING ANY OF THE 
FOLLOWING: (A) GIVING US A WRITTEN OR ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE, OR TELLING 
US ORALLY THAT YOU ACCEPT; (B) ACTIVATING OR CONTINUING SERVICE; (C) 
USING YOUR SERVICE AFTER YOUR SERVICE IS ACTIVATED OR YOU MAKE A CHANGE 
OR ADDITION TO YOUR SERVICE; (D) PAYING FOR THE SERVICE; OR (E) FAILING 
TO ACTIVATE SERVICE WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER THE PURCHASE OF YOUR WIRELESS 
DEVICE.&nbsp;<b>IF YOU ARE A NEW CUSTOMER AND YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT DO ANY OF THESE THINGS.</b></p>
<p><b>IF YOU ARE AN EXISTING CUSTOMER AND THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED TO YOU
 UNDER A PRIOR AGREEMENT AND YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU 
MUST TERMINATE SERVICE AS SET FORTH IN THE PRIOR AGREEMENT</b>; 
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT IF YOU CHOOSE TO TERMINATE SERVICE YOU WILL 
STILL BE BOUND BY THE PRIOR AGREEMENT, INCLUDING YOUR OBLIGATION TO PAY 
ANY OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS AND YOUR AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES. IF YOU
 HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, DO NOT ACTIVATE OR USE YOUR SERVICE, AND CONTACT 
METROPCS OR ITS AUTHORIZED DEALERS TO HAVE YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED.</p>
<p><b>2. * Dispute Resolution and Arbitration. We each agree that, 
except as provided below, any and all claims or Disputes between you and
 us, in any way related to or concerning the Agreement, our Privacy 
Policy, our Services, devices or products, will be resolved by binding 
arbitration.</b>&nbsp;This includes any claims against other parties 
relating to Services or wireless devices provided or billed to you (such
 as our suppliers, Dealers or third party vendors) whenever you also 
assert claims against us in the same proceeding. "Dispute" shall be 
given the broadest possible meaning and shall include any dispute, 
claim, or controversy arising from or relating to this Agreement or 
Services and/or Products provided under this Agreement, including but 
not limited to: (1) all claims for relief and all theories of liability,
 whether based in contract, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, fraud,
 or misrepresentation; (2) all disputes regarding the validity, 
enforceability or scope of this arbitration agreement (with the 
exception of its class action waiver); (3) all disputes that arose 
before this Agreement; (4) all disputes that arise after the termination
 of this Agreement; and (5) all disputes that are the subject of a 
putative class action in which no class has been certified. References 
in this provision to "us" include our parents, subsidiaries, affiliates,
 predecessors, successors, and assigns and our and their directors, 
officers, employees and agents. References in this provision to "you" 
include all beneficiaries of this Agreement and all users of the 
Services provided under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
either party may bring an individual action in small claims court or 
bring Disputes to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, 
including, but not limited to, the Federal Communications Commission.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to be bound by this arbitration agreement, you 
must notify us of your desire to do so within 30 days of initiating 
Service, or, if you have never had the opportunity to opt out of 
arbitration, within 30 days of the date of the change notice giving you 
the opportunity. To do so, please visit <a href="http://www.metropcsdisputeresolution.com/"><u>www.metropcsdisputeresolution.com</u></a>
 and follow the instructions on that site. Your decision to opt out of 
this arbitration agreement will not adversely affect our relationship 
with or delivery of Service to you. If you have previously notified us 
of your decision to opt out of this arbitration agreement, you need not 
do so again.</p>
<p>For all disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must 
first give us an opportunity to resolve your claim by sending a written 
description of your claim to the address in Section 16 below. We each 
agree to negotiate your claim in good faith. If we are unable to resolve
 the claim within 60 days after we receive your claim description, you 
may pursue your claim in arbitration. We each agree that if you fail to 
timely pay amounts due, we may assign your account for collection, and 
the collection agency may pursue, in small claims court, claims limited 
strictly to the collection of the past due amounts and any interest or 
cost of collection permitted by law or this Agreement.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if 
we change this arbitration agreement, you may reject the change without 
terminating or adversely affecting your Service by notifying us in 
writing at the address set forth in the "Notices" section below within 
30 days of the date of the change notice. If you do, you shall arbitrate
 any Dispute in accordance with the terms of this arbitration agreement.
 If you do not, you will be bound by the changes.</p>
<p>Because this Agreement and the Services provided under this Agreement
 concern interstate commerce, this arbitration agreement shall be 
governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA").</p>
<p>The party initiating arbitration may choose from the following independent, impartial arbitration administrators:</p>
<p><b>American Arbitration Association</b><br>
335 Madison Avenue,<br>
Floor 10<br>
New York, NY 10017<br>
1-800-778-7879<br>
www.adr.org&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Copies of their respective rules for consumer disputes and forms and 
instructions for initiating arbitration may be obtained by contacting 
them or visiting their websites. Any arbitration shall be conducted 
pursuant to the arbitration administrator's rules for consumer disputes 
in effect when the arbitration is initiated except to the extent they 
are inconsistent with this arbitration agreement. If the arbitration 
administrator will not enforce this arbitration agreement as written, 
the parties shall agree on or mutually petition a court of competent 
jurisdiction to appoint a substitute arbitration administrator who will 
do so. The arbitrator shall enforce contractual, statutory and other 
limitation periods and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at 
law. Judgment upon any arbitration award may be entered in any court 
having jurisdiction.</p>
<p>If we initiate the arbitration, we will notify you in writing at your
 then-current account address or (if your account is closed) the last 
address at which we contacted you. If you initiate the arbitration, you 
must notify us in writing at the address set forth in the "Notices" 
section below.</p>
<p>If your Dispute does not exceed $10,000, we will promptly reimburse 
your filing fee and will pay the arbitrator's other fees, costs and 
expenses. (If you cannot pay the filing fee, you may request that we pay
 the filing fee directly.) If, however, the arbitrator finds that your 
Dispute is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, you shall 
reimburse the filing fee to us and the payment of the arbitrator's 
others fees, costs and expenses shall be governed by the arbitration 
administrator's rules.</p>
<p>You may hire an attorney to represent you in the arbitration 
proceeding and may recover your reasonable attorneys' fees and costs in 
arbitration to the same extent as you could in court if the arbitration 
proceeding is decided in your favor. We may hire an attorney to 
represent us in the arbitration proceeding but waive any right to 
recover our attorneys' fees and costs if the arbitration proceeding is 
decided in our favor.</p>
<p>Unless you and we agree otherwise in writing, any arbitration 
hearings will be held in the county of your then-current account address
 or (if your account is closed) the last address at which we contacted 
you.</p>
<p><b>If the arbitration provision applies or you choose arbitration to 
resolve your disputes, then either you or we may start arbitration 
proceedings.</b>&nbsp;You must send a letter requesting arbitration and 
describing your claim to our registered agent (see Section 16) to begin 
arbitration. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will arbitrate
 all disputes. For claims less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary 
Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for claims over 
$75,000, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. The AAA 
rules are available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>&nbsp;or
 by calling 1-800-778-7879. Upon filing of the arbitration demand, we 
will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees for claims that 
total less than $75,000. For claims that total more than $75,000, the 
payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed 
by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules. An arbitrator may award on an 
individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, 
including injunctive or declaratory relief and attorneys’ fees. In 
addition, for claims under $75,000 as to which you provided notice and 
negotiated in good faith as required above before initiating 
arbitration, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party 
in the arbitration, you will be entitled to a recovery of reasonable 
attorneys’ fees and costs. Except for claims determined to be frivolous,
 Metro PCS agrees not to seek an award of attorneys’ fees in arbitration
 even if an award is otherwise available under applicable law.</p>
<p><b><u>CLASS ACTION WAIVER</u>. WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE 
RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE 
CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR 
REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR 
REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.</b>&nbsp;If a court or arbitrator determines in 
an action between you and us that this Class Action Waiver is 
unenforceable, the arbitration agreement will be void as to you.&nbsp;<b>If
 you choose to pursue your claim in court by opting out of the 
arbitration provision as specified above, this Class Action Waiver 
provision will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other customer, 
can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in
 a class, consolidated or representative proceeding without having 
complied with the opt out requirements above.</b></p>
<p><b><u>JURY TRIAL WAIVER</u>.</b>&nbsp;If a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration,&nbsp;<b>WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL</b>.</p>
<p>ARBITRATION INVOLVES A FAIR HEARING BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR 
RATHER THAN A JUDGE OR JURY. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD DECLARATORY OR 
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY NAMED IN THE 
ARBITRATION PROCEEDING AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE 
RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, or otherwise in this 
Agreement, neither party has the right to bring a Dispute or other legal
 action under this Agreement more than one (1) year after the Dispute 
arose.</p>
<p><b>3. * Your Term of Service.&nbsp;</b>You are a month-to-month 
customer. If you terminate your Service, your termination will be 
effective at the end of your current month of Service (unless you 
port-out your number), and you will remain responsible for all fees and 
Charges for your Service and usage through the end of that period. If we
 terminate your Service, we will determine the date of termination, and 
you will be responsible for all usage and Charges through the date of 
termination. You can request that we port your number to another 
carrier, and Service for that number will be terminated when the porting
 is complete.&nbsp; If you port your number, you will be responsible for
 all usage and Charges until the port-out is complete.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Services are provided via Rate Plans under which you do not pay 
metered "per minute" charges for service. In an effort to offer this 
Service on a reliable basis, MetroPCS may discontinue providing Service 
to you, change the services provided to you, change your Rate Plan, 
reduce the speed of any service provided, restrict the amount of use of 
any service, change the services and features in your Rate Plan, 
discontinue your account, or discontinue or limit providing connections 
to particular telephone numbers, countries, destinations, providers, 
features, requested or called by you or the provision of certain 
services in certain areas, such as pursuant to roaming arrangements, or 
services that appear likely to generate abnormally high use, or other 
disproportionate use when compared to those of other customers of 
MetroPCS (as described below under Section 24 "Your Use Of The Service")
 or which may be harmful, disruptive, or interfere with MetroPCS' system
 or services to other customers. We may provide notice to you prior to 
taking any of the foregoing actions, but you acknowledge and agree that 
we are not required to provide notice and you agree that we may take any
 of the foregoing actions without providing notice you. By initiating 
service and placing calls or using any other service on the MetroPCS 
system, you acknowledge and agree to MetroPCS' ability to modify or 
terminate your Service under these circumstances.</p>
<p><b>4. &nbsp;Return Policy and Refund Policy.</b>&nbsp;For MetroPCS 
Device and accessory returns and exchanges, see the applicable return 
policy, which is available at your place of purchase. Amounts paid for 
Service charges are non-refundable.&nbsp; If your Service is terminated 
for any reason and you have a positive balance in your Service account, 
you will not be entitled to receive any refund.</p>
<p><b>5. &nbsp;Changes to Your Service.</b>&nbsp;This Section describes 
how changes may be made to your Agreement, is subject to requirements 
and limitations imposed by applicable law, and will not be enforced to 
the extent prohibited by law. We may change the price and structure of 
your Rate Plan, modify the various Rate Plans, change the price of the 
various Rate Plans, change the services included in a Rate Plan, or 
change the requirements of eligibility for Rate Plans, at any time 
without prior notice to you. You may designate others to manage or make 
changes to your account ("Authorized Users"). You and any Authorized 
Users on your account will have access to all account information. If 
you give your personal account validation information to someone, they 
can access, and may be able to make changes to your account just as you 
can, including incurring charges for which you are responsible. Those 
changes will be binding on you. MetroPCS takes no responsibility for 
changes made to your account by any Authorized User.</p>
<p>With respect to domestic long distance, roaming, international long 
distance, and any other service provided by us (or to us by third 
parties), we may change the locations and destinations where such 
Services may be used or where calls can be placed or placed in specific 
Rate Plans, or the rates and terms applicable to such locations and 
destinations, without prior notice to you. Certain charges may be 
imposed by third parties and MetroPCS may, as an accommodation, allow 
such charges to be paid through MetroPCS.</p>
<p>YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE TO ACCEPT THESE RATE PLAN CHANGES. IF 
YOU DO NOT WANT TO ACCEPT THE RATE PLAN CHANGES, YOU MUST NOTIFY US IN 
WRITING WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF THE DATE OF THE CHANGE THAT YOU WISH TO 
TERMINATE SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT NOTIFY US THAT YOU WISH TO TERMINATE 
SERVICE WITHIN THAT TIME AND/OR IF YOU CONTINUE TO USE THE SERVICE AFTER
 THE RATE PLAN CHANGES, YOU ACCEPT THE CHANGES. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY 
TERMINATION, AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY PAID ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.</p>
<p><b>6.&nbsp; Our Rights to Make Changes.</b>&nbsp; We may change this 
Agreement at any time. If you are an existing customer, you will be 
notified at least ten (10) days, unless a longer period is required, in 
advance of any proposed changes that may result in more restrictive 
terms or conditions in this Agreement. Any such changes to this 
Agreement will be effective after that time period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE CHANGES. IF YOU DO NOT 
WANT TO ACCEPT THE CHANGES, YOU MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING WITHIN TEN 
(10) DAYS OF THE DATE OF THE CHANGE NOTICE THAT YOU WISH TO TERMINATE 
SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT NOTIFY US THAT YOU WISH TO TERMINATE SERVICE 
WITHIN THAT TIME AND/OR IF YOU CONTINUE TO USE THE SERVICE AFTER 
NOTIFICATION OF THE CHANGES, YOU ACCEPT THE CHANGES.</p>
<p><b>7. * Your Wireless Device and Compatibility with Other Networks and Equipment.</b>&nbsp;You
 may buy a wireless device to use on our Service from us or someone 
else, but it must, as solely determined by us, comply with Federal 
Communications Commission regulations, be certified for use on our 
network, and be compatible with, and not potentially harm, our Service 
or our network. Our Services will only work with wireless devices 
compatible with our network and not all services are available with all 
wireless devices or on all networks. Some features and Rate Plans will 
be available only on MetroPCS wireless devices purchased from us. At 
times we may remotely change your wireless device's software, 
applications or programming, without notice to address security, safety,
 or other issues that impact our network or your device. These changes 
will modify your wireless device and may affect or erase data you have 
&nbsp;stored on your wireless device, or how you have programmed or use 
your wireless device. A MetroPCS wireless device is designed to be used 
only with our service and on our network. Your wireless device may not 
work with another wireless network, or the other wireless carrier may 
not accept your wireless device on its network. If your wireless device 
was purchased from MetroPCS or an authorized MetroPCS dealer, the 
wireless device has a software programming lock that will prevent the 
wireless device from operating with other compatible wireless telephone 
carriers' services. Please see www.metropcs.com/unlockpolicy for 
information regarding our software programming unlocking policy. Your 
wireless device may contain sensitive or personal information. MetroPCS 
is not responsible for any information on your wireless device, 
including sensitive or personal information. If possible, you should 
remove or otherwise safeguard any sensitive or personal information when
 your wireless device is out of your possession or control, including, 
but not limited to, relinquishing, exchanging, returning or recycling 
your wireless device. By providing your wireless device to us, you agree
 that our employees, contractors or vendors may access all of the 
information on your wireless device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>8.&nbsp; Service Availability.</b>&nbsp;Service is limited to the 
operating range, spectrum, and capacity of our, or our roaming 
partners’, wireless system in your service area. Your Service area is 
the area depicted in the coverage map available to you when you 
activated Service and may change from time to time without notice. Since
 MetroPCS uses different spectrum in different areas of the country, 
service may not be available on all wireless devices in all areas. We 
may, but are not obligated to, provide notice when you are being served 
by a carrier other than ourselves. The specific network coverage you get
 will depend on the radio transmissions your wireless device can receive
 and use, and the Services you have chosen.<b>&nbsp;Specific Services 
may not be available on all wireless devices at all points in time due 
to wireless device hardware and/or software, changes to our network, 
network infrastructure, cessation of specific Services, or service by 
carriers other than ourselves.</b>&nbsp;Except for 911 calls and any 
"roaming" service to which you have subscribed, you will not be able to 
use your wireless device outside of your service area for any calls, 
including local, long distance and international calls. Further, since 
services outside MetroPCS' area are provided by third parties, not all 
services may work outside your service area.<b>&nbsp;Service depends on 
over-the-air radio transmissions. Our coverage maps provide high level 
estimates of our coverage areas when using Services outdoors under 
optimal conditions. Coverage is not available everywhere and depends on 
the Service purchased and the wireless device used. Service speeds are 
not guaranteed and actual speeds will vary. Estimating wireless 
coverage, signal strength and Service speed is not an exact science. 
There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that may 
result in dropped and/or blocked connections, slower Service speeds, or 
otherwise impact the quality of Service. Many factors beyond our control
 affect your ability to make and receive calls on your wireless device, 
the quality of those calls, and the speed of your Service including, but
 not limited to, your location, the conditions of the atmosphere, 
terrain, nearby buildings and other structures, network capacity issues,
 system outages, failure of equipment to operate as expected, spectrum 
used, problems that occur with service we purchase from third parties, 
system upgrades, performance of system maintenance, accidents, network 
problems, network or Internet congestion, software, signal strength, 
your wireless device, weather, geography, topography, server speeds of 
the websites you access or other events outside of our control. As a 
result, sometimes Service, including calls or attempted calls to 
emergency services like 911, may be unavailable, interrupted or may 
fail, and the quality of calls may sometimes be poor.&nbsp;</b>MetroPCS 
takes no responsibility for Service interruptions or problems caused by 
factors beyond our control. Any statements by MetroPCS, its employees, 
representatives or agents about the coverage of our system are intended 
only to describe MetroPCS' approximate coverage in your service area. 
You should not interpret any such statement to mean that Service will be
 available or without interruption in any service area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>9.&nbsp; Location Based Services; Important Emergency and 9-1-1 Information; and Emergency Alerts.</b>&nbsp;
 When making a 911 call, always state the nature of your emergency and 
provide both your location and phone number, as the operator may not 
automatically receive this information.&nbsp;<b>MetroPCS is not responsible for failures to connect or complete 911 calls or if inaccurate location information is provided.</b>&nbsp;<b>911 service may not be available or reliable and your ability to receive emergency services may be impeded.&nbsp;</b>Services
 that rely on location information, such as E911, GPS navigation, and 
our wireless network depend on your wireless device's ability to acquire
 satellite signals and network coverage. Unlike traditional wireline 
telephones, depending on a number of factors (for example, where you 
are, whether local emergency service providers have upgraded their 
equipment, etc.), 911 operators may not know your telephone number, your
 location or the location of your wireless device. Other third party 
entities are involved in connecting a 911 call. MetroPCS makes no 
guarantee that emergency 911 calls will be routed to a specific Public 
Safety Answering Point ("PSAP") or any particular public safety 
organization (for example, police department, fire department, ambulance
 services, etc.). MetroPCS takes no responsibility for the acts or 
omissions of any PSAP or any public safety organization (for example, 
police department, fire department, ambulance services, etc.). In 
certain circumstances, an emergency call may be routed to a state patrol
 dispatcher or alternative location set by local emergency service 
providers. Enhanced 911 service ("E911"), where enabled by local 
emergency authorities, uses GPS or network technologies to provide 
location information. Even when available, however, E911 does not always
 provide accurate location information, and in some cases may not 
generate a location at all. If your wireless device is indoors or for 
some other reason cannot acquire a satellite signal, you may not be 
located. Some wireless devices have a safety feature that prevents use 
of the keypad after dialing 911. You should follow voice prompts when 
interacting with emergency service providers employing Interactive Voice
 Response ("IVR") systems to screen calls. While your wireless device is
 receiving a software update, you may be unable to use your wireless 
device in any manner until the software update is complete. If you are 
porting a phone number to or from us, we may not be able to provide you 
with some Services, such as 9-1-1 location services, while the port is 
in process. Your wireless device may require you to elect to use 
location based services, or you may choose to use location based 
services, other than E911. If you elect to use non-E911 location based 
services, you agree that we may use the location information transmitted
 from your wireless device to improve our location services. Your 
personal, biographical and calling information will not be used by us. 
By electing to use location based services, you agree and authorize us 
to send targeted, location based information to your mobile device and 
also to use or provide to third parties your location information in an 
aggregate form.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><u>Emergency Alerts</u>.</b>&nbsp;MetroPCS
 has chosen to offer wireless emergency alerts, within portions of its 
coverage area, on wireless alert capable Devices. There is no additional
 charge for these wireless emergency alerts. For details on the 
availability of this service and wireless emergency alert capable 
Devices, please visit

<p><b>10. * Data Plans and Other Features. Data Access.</b>&nbsp;Depending
 on your Rate Plan, your usage of Data Access may be metered by Us. Your
 Rate Plan may include a Data Access usage limit, such as 2 GB per 
service cycle. We shall determine in our sole discretion what data usage
 constitutes Data Access and reserve the right to alter, make additions 
to or deletions to what type of data usage, or protocols, constitute 
Data Access without notification to you. Data Access may include, for 
example, multimedia streaming and video on demand services, as well as 
certain multimedia uploads, downloads and gaming services and 
applications. Uploads are data sessions where the data is transferred 
from your Wireless Device to some other computer or wireless device, 
while downloads are data sessions where the data is transferred from 
some other computer or wireless device to your Wireless Device. 
Depending on your Rate Plan, certain usages may not count against your 
Data Access limit. Data Access does not include any data services or 
uses which are prohibited by Us under this Agreement, such as in the 
MetroWEB Terms of Use. Data Access usage includes, but is not limited 
to, the actual data sent and received along with overhead, header 
packets, and may include other information sent in connection with a 
data session in which Data Access occurs. Data Access on networks not 
owned by us, such as when you are roaming, may not be available or may 
be further limited. Charges and availability are based on the location 
of the cell site receiving and transmitting the Data Access service and 
not your location.</p>
<p>The absolute capacity of the wireless data network is limited. 
Accordingly, Data Access is only provided for prescribed purposes and 
pricing for Data Access is device dependent and based on the transmit 
and receive capacity of each device. A Data Access pricing plan 
designated for one type of device may not be used with another device. 
Compatible data-enabled wireless devices are required.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that your Data Access usage and speed may 
vary depending on certain factors outside of our control. Such factors 
may include the amount of users on the service, network congestion, the 
distance to the serving cell site, the number of users served by your 
serving cell site, the management of backhaul at the serving cell site, 
any application(s) you are using for your data session, the screen size 
of your Wireless Device, the bit rate(s) of your data session, the 
type(s) and amount(s) of compression used by the computers or wireless 
devices involved in the data session, and any error(s) that might occur 
in the data session. We also manage our network to facilitate the proper
 functioning of services that require consistent high speeds, such as 
video calling, which may, particularly at times and in areas of network 
congestion, result in reduced speeds for other services. Additionally, 
we may implement other network management practices, such as deploying 
streaming video optimization technology and prioritizing all Smartphone 
Mobile Hotspot (tethering) data below on-device data. This technology is
 intended to manage data usage on the network, reduce the risk of 
streaming video stalling and buffering, and reduce the amount of 
high-speed data consumption used for streaming video.&nbsp; Streaming 
video optimization improves streaming video reliability as well as makes
 room for other users to enjoy higher browsing speeds.&nbsp; The 
streaming video optimization process is agnostic as to the streaming 
video content itself and to the website that provides it.&nbsp; While 
most changes to streaming video files are likely to be indiscernible, 
the optimization process may minimally impact the appearance of the 
streaming video as displayed on a user’s device. These practices operate
 without regard to the content itself or the source of the content, and 
do not discriminate against offerings that might compete against those 
offered by MetroPCS on the basis of such competition. In order to assess
 your usage during an applicable service cycle, you may obtain 
approximate usage information by using one of our automated systems. Any
 application on your Wireless Device which describes the amount of data 
usage does not necessarily reflect your usage of Data Access. We may 
provide a meter for your use in one or more locations accessible by you.
 Any meter provided for your use may deliver readings higher or lower 
than your actual Data Access usage, or deliver readings that are higher 
than your actual Data Access usage because of the units of measurement 
used by Us. Any reading delivered by any meter we provide for your use 
will have inherent inaccuracies and may not provide up to the minute or 
second accuracy. Further, any reading delivered by any meter We provide 
for your use may only be completely accurate if your Wireless Device is 
turned off and not transmitting or receiving any data from any data 
session.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u>Network Traffic Management.</u></b>&nbsp;MetroPCS reserves the 
right to manage our network and the traffic on our network in the way we
 believe best benefits our customers and best enables us to maintain 
Service of the nature described in this Agreement. We have determined 
that our ability to provide Service to our customers is disrupted when 
you place an abnormally high number of calls, repeatedly place calls 
which result in abnormally long call lengths, high or disproportionate 
use, or otherwise use our Services or network in excess of our 
expectations for the normal amount of use by our customers. Other 
examples of prohibited uses can be found in Section 17. If you use your 
service in a manner that could interfere with other customers’ service, 
affect our ability to allocate network capacity among customers or 
degrade service quality for other customers, we may suspend, terminate, 
or restrict your Service.&nbsp; Some elements of multimedia messages may
 not be accessible, viewable, or heard due to limitations on certain 
wireless phones, PCs, or e-mail. We reserve the right to change the 
multimedia message size limit at any time without notification. Text 
message notifications may be sent to non-multimedia messaging 
subscribers if they subscribe to text messaging. You may receive 
unsolicited messages from third parties as a result of visiting Internet
 sites, and a per-message charge may apply whether the message is read 
or unread, solicited or unsolicited.</p>
<p>To differentiate the services we sell, at times and at locations 
where there are competing customer demands for network resources, we 
give the data traffic of customers who choose T-Mobile-branded services 
precedence over the data traffic of customers who choose 
non-T-Mobile-branded services such as MetroPCS.&nbsp; Where the network 
is lightly loaded, a MetroPCS customer will notice little, if any, 
effect from having lower priority. This will be the case in the vast 
majority of times and locations. At times and at locations where the 
network is heavily loaded in relation to available capacity, however, 
MetroPCS customers will likely see reductions in data speeds, especially
 if they are engaged in data-intensive activities. Customers on Rate 
Plans and Devices with 4G capability should, for example, be aware that 
these practices may occaisionally result in speeds below those typically
 experienced on our 4G LTE and HSPA networks. MetroPCS constantly works 
to improve network performance and capacity, but there are physical and 
technical limits on how much capacity is available, and at constrained 
locations, the frequency of heavy loading in relation to available 
capacity may be greater than at other locations. When network loading 
goes down or the MetroPCS customer moves to a location that is less 
heavily loaded in relation to available capacity, the MetroPCS 
customer‘s speeds will likely improve. &nbsp;See 
metropcs.com/openinternet for details.</p>
<p>MetroPCS also reserves the right to restrict, or otherwise prevent 
access to services, countries, carriers, destinations that MetroPCS 
determines, in its sole discretion, are inconsistent with the nature of 
Service provided by MetroPCS, are indicative of uses not permitted 
hereunder, or result in abnormally long calls, or abnormally high usage.
 We also may block calls to telephone numbers at the request of the 
called party.</p>
<p><b>11. * Content and Applications.</b>&nbsp;You can purchase Content 
and Applications (for example, downloadable, streaming or networked 
applications, wallpapers, ringtones, games, productivity tools and 
video) ("Content and Apps") for and with your compatible wireless 
device. Some Content and Apps that you can purchase with your wireless 
device are not sold by MetroPCS and for such Content and Apps, you can 
identify the third party seller at the point of purchase. MetroPCS is 
not responsible for such Content and Apps, including download, 
installation, use, transmission failure, interruption, or delay, or any 
content or website you may be able to access through the Content and 
Apps. Any support questions for such Content and Apps should be directed
 to the third party seller identified at the point of purchase. When you
 download or install any Content and Apps sold by a third party seller, 
you may be subject to license terms between you and the third party 
seller and Content and Apps creator/owner. When you use, install, 
display, run, or listen to Content and Apps that you purchase from 
MetroPCS, the Content and Apps are licensed to you by MetroPCS and may 
be subject to additional license terms between you and the creator/owner
 of the Content and Apps. Whether purchased from MetroPCS or a third 
party seller, any Content and Apps you purchase are licensed for 
personal, lawful, non-commercial use on your wireless device only. You 
may not transfer, copy, or reverse engineer any Content and Apps, or 
alter, disable or circumvent any digital rights management security 
features embedded in the Content and Apps. Content and Apps may not be 
transferable from one wireless device to another wireless device. You 
understand and agree that the Content and Apps contain the intellectual 
property of third parties. You understand and agree that the Content and
 Apps are protected by law (including copyright law) and are solely for 
your personal, non-commercial use. You agree to comply with all 
applicable laws (including copyright law), and may only make such copies
 as are reasonably necessary for your personal and non-commercial use. 
You agree that any other redistribution, reproduction, transmission, 
communication, sale, use (including, except in the case of Ringtones, as
 a "ringer" for a telephone), broadcast, public performance, rental or 
lending, adaptation, sub-license or other use of the Content and Apps 
without the prior written consent of the copyright owner is prohibited. 
You understand and agree that all rights not expressly granted herein 
are reserved by the applicable content owner.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><u>Third Party Applications</u>.</b>&nbsp;Your
 location can be identified while using GPS applications. It is your 
responsibility to notify Authorized Users that their location can be 
identified while using GPS applications. If you use a third party 
application, the application may access, collect, use or disclose your 
personal information or require MetroPCS to disclose your information, 
including location information (when applicable), to the application 
provider or some other third party. If you access, use or authorize 
third party applications through the Services, you agree and authorize 
MetroPCS to provide information related to your use of the Services or 
the application(s). You understand that your use of third party 
applications is subject to the third party's terms and conditions and 
policies, including the third party's privacy policy. You agree that any
 Authorized User may access, use or authorize MetroPCS or third party 
location-sensitive applications through the Services. You understand 
that your use of such location-sensitive applications is subject to the 
application's terms and conditions and policies, including its privacy 
policy. If you activate location-sensitive services for wireless devices
 used by other Authorized Users, you agree to inform the Authorized 
User(s) of the terms of use for location-sensitive applications and that
 the wireless device may be located. For additional information on 
location-sensitive services, see our Privacy Policy at our website.</p>
<p><b>12. * Off-Net Usage and Roaming.</b>&nbsp;<b><u>Off-Net Usage.</u>&nbsp;</b>Your
 wireless device may connect to another provider’s network (“Off-Net”) 
even when you are within our service area. Our Services and Rate Plans 
are designed for you to use your Service each month predominantly using 
our networks. You must use your wireless device predominantly within the
 MetroPCS owned network coverage area. If your minutes of use, text 
messaging usage, or data usage are not predominantly on our networks 
("Off-Net Usage"), or are excessive, abnormally high, or cause MetroPCS 
to incur too much cost, MetroPCS may, at its option and sole discretion,
 limit or terminate your service, deny your continued use outside the 
areas served by our network or on other carriers' coverage, or change 
your Rate Plan. MetroPCS will provide you with advance notice that it 
intends to take any of the above actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><u>Roaming</u>.&nbsp;</b>Nationwide
 roaming requires multi-band wireless devices and is not available with 
single-band wireless devices, certain other wireless devices, or to 
customers residing outside their home area. Data services and certain 
features (for example, Voicemail, Caller ID, Call Waiting, Location 
Services, etc.) may not be available in all roaming areas. The term 
"roaming" typically refers to coverage on another carrier's network that
 we may make available to you based on our agreements with other 
carriers. These agreements may change from time to time and roaming 
coverage and available services are subject to change without notice. 
Your ability to roam depends on the radio transmissions your wireless 
device can receive and use, and the availability of roaming coverage. We
 make no guaranty that roaming coverage will be available. Roaming 
coverage may exist both within and outside our network coverage areas. 
Depending on your Services, separate charges or limits on the amount of 
minutes used while roaming may apply. We may, but you agree we are not 
obligated to, provide you with notice when you are roaming.<b>&nbsp;YOU 
AGREE TO HOLD METROPCS HARMLESS AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS, 
ACTIONS, OR OTHER CAUSES OF ACTION (INCLUDING ACTIONS BY THIRD PARTIES) 
ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR ATTEMPTED 
USE OF THE SERVICE.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>13. * Charges; Taxes and Fees.&nbsp;</b>You agree to pay for all 
charges for Service ("Service Charges"), including, but not limited to 
the following: (1) recurring monthly or weekly access charges; (2) 
charges and taxes for optional Service features that you select, 
including long distance and directory assistance (411) calls and other 
optional features, such as ringtone downloads; (3) any Service 
reconnection charges that may apply, such as a reactivation fee; and (4)
 all applicable taxes and regulatory charges whether assessed directly 
on you or us; provided, however, that for certain tax inclusive Rate 
Plans, only applicable taxes and regulatory charges may be included in 
the Rate Plan price. You must pay all taxes, fees and surcharges set by 
federal, state and local governments. To determine taxes, fees and 
surcharges, we will use the street address you identified as your Place 
of Primary Use ("PPU"). If you did not identify the correct PPU, or 
provided an address that is not a recognized street address, such as a 
PO Box, does not identify the applicable taxing jurisdictions or does 
not reflect the Service area associated with your telephone number, you 
may be assigned a default PPU for tax purposes. You acknowledge and 
agree that a default PPU may affect your ability to receive E-911 
assistance and you agree to indemnify and hold us harmless for any 
claims relating to your failure to provide a valid PPU. In addition, if 
you are not on a tax-inclusive plan, you agree to pay all regulatory 
administration charges ("Regulatory Administration Charges"), which may 
include, but are not limited to, Federal Universal Service, various 
regulatory charges, our administrative charges, gross receipts charges, 
margin taxes, and charges for the costs we incur in complying with 
governmental programs. Regulatory Administration Charges are not taxes 
and are not required by law. We set these charges, and the amounts and 
what they include may change without notice. They are rates we choose to
 collect from you and are kept by us in whole or in part. The number and
 type of Regulatory Administration Charges may vary depending upon the 
PPU of the wireless device and can change over time. We determine the 
rate for these charges and these amounts are subject to change as are 
the components used to calculate these amounts. Changes to taxes, fees 
and surcharges will become effective as provided by the taxing authority
 and changes to Regulatory Administration Charges shall be effective 
immediately. You are responsible for all Charges to your account, 
whether or not you were the user of the wireless device. If your 
wireless device gets lost or stolen, you agree to notify us immediately,
 so we can suspend your Service to prevent someone else from using it. 
After your Service is suspended, you will not be responsible for 
additional usage charges incurred in excess of your Rate Plan Charges, 
applicable taxes, fees, and Surcharges. If you request that we not 
suspend your Service, you will remain responsible for all usage, Charges
 incurred, and applicable taxes and fees. We may prevent a lost or 
stolen wireless device from registering on our and other networks. 
Wireless access to corporate/employee email may require additional 
server or server access, licenses, or additional requirements which may 
incur additional charges. By requesting wireless access to 
corporate/employee email, you agree to pay any of these additional 
charges.&nbsp;<b><u>Billing for Third-Party Services</u>.</b>&nbsp;Certain
 parties besides MetroPCS have the ability to place charges on your bill
 for their services. You may access these services and authorize the 
placement of charges on your bill through your phone or online account. 
MetroPCS also provides customers, at no additional cost, with the 
ability to restrict the placement of charges for third-party services on
 your account. Contact customer care at 1-888-8metro8 or go to&nbsp;<u>www.metropcs.com/blocking</u>&nbsp;for more information.</p>
<p><b>14. * Payments and Late Fees.</b>&nbsp;Service Charges must be 
paid in advance and are due before the first day of your service cycle. 
Service Charges cannot be paid in arrears. Unless otherwise specified in
 your Rate Plan, monthly service cycles are approximately 30 days long. 
The dates of your monthly or weekly service cycle and other dates 
related to your account may change from time to time. You must promptly 
notify us of any change in your billing address. As a convenience, you 
may authorize recurring payment of your Service Charges through a credit
 or debit card or bank transfer authorization; this authorizes us to 
charge all amounts you owe us to the credit or debit card or bank 
transfer authorization up to five (5) days prior to the due date and to 
demand immediate payment from the card or debit issuer or bank. Unless 
required by law, we will not give any additional notice to you or obtain
 additional consent from you before charging Service Charges to that 
credit or debit card. You must promptly notify us of any change in the 
credit or debit card or bank transfer authorization you want to use for 
payment. You may also make a payment by credit or debit card online at 
www.metropcs.com or through the automated MetroPCS IVR. In addition, you
 may pay your Service Charges by sending a check or money order by mail 
to P.O. Box 5119, Carol Stream, Illinois, 60197-5119, or by bringing 
cash, check, or money order in person to any MetroPCS store or 
authorized payment center. You may be required to pay an additional 
service charge, depending on the payment method you choose. This 
information is available at MetroPCS.com. In addition, we may charge an 
additional fee up to the maximum amount permitted by law for any check 
or other negotiable instrument tendered by you and returned unpaid by a 
financial institution for any reason. We reserve the right, in our sole 
discretion, to require that you pay your Service Charges with cash, 
certified check, cashier's check, or money order. We also reserve the 
right to report any check returned to us to reporting and credit 
agencies and law enforcement.</p>
<p><b>15. * Your right to Dispute Charges.&nbsp;</b>Your payment will be
 considered late if we do not receive it before the first day of the 
service cycle for which the payment is due. If you do not make all 
payments when they are due, you will be in default under this Agreement,
 and MetroPCS will be entitled to exercise any rights it may have under 
this Agreement, including the suspension or termination of Service to 
you. If we accept a late or partial payment, even if you mark the 
payment "paid in full," we do not waive our rights to suspend or 
terminate your Service or any other rights we may have. If your Service 
is terminated and you promptly pay amounts that are overdue, MetroPCS, 
in its sole discretion, may reconnect your Service after you have paid 
any reconnection fees we have imposed. In such case, your service cycle 
anniversary date will not change, which will result in fewer days of 
service for that month. If you have a dispute regarding the Charges to 
your account, or about the Services provided to you, you agree to notify
 us of the dispute within 60 days after the date you first receive the 
disputed Charge ("Dispute Period"), unless otherwise provided by law. If
 you do not notify us of your dispute in writing within the Dispute 
Period, you have waived such claim and will be forever barred and 
estopped from raising, or making a claim for such dispute and you may 
not pursue a claim in arbitration or in court. Unless otherwise provided
 by law, you must pay disputed Charges until the dispute is resolved. If
 you accept a credit, refund or other compensation or benefit to resolve
 a disputed Charge, you agree that the issue is fully and finally 
resolved and such credit shall act as an accord and satisfaction. 
&nbsp;In the event of a lost or stolen wireless device, for Charges 
incurred before you notify us, you are not liable for charges you did 
not authorize, but the fact that your wireless device or service was 
used is some evidence of authorization. You may request that we 
investigate Charges you believe were unauthorized. We may ask you to 
provide information and you may submit information to support your 
request. If we determine the charges were unauthorized, we will credit 
your account. If we determine the charges were authorized, we will 
inform you within 30 days and you will remain responsible for the 
charges.</p>
<p><b>16. * Notices and Customer Communications.&nbsp;</b>You expressly 
consent to be contacted, by MetroPCS or anyone calling on its behalf, 
for any and all purposes, at any telephone number, or physical or 
electronic address where you may be reached, including any wireless 
telephone number. You agree that MetroPCS may contact you in any way, 
including, pre-recorded or artificial voice or text messages delivered 
by an automatic telephone dialing system, or e-mail messages delivered 
by an automatic e-mailing system. You agree that we also have the 
consent to contact any Authorized User on your account for Service or 
payment related reasons. Any such notice will be treated as provided to 
you when left with you, on your wireless device, on your 
answering/voicemail service, or by email or fax to any email or fax 
number you provided to us, or 3-days after mailing to your last known 
address as shown in our records. Your consent to be contacted may be 
revoked only if it is in writing and is with MetroPCS’s express 
agreement. You must notify us of any address changes. Failure to notify 
us of a change in your address constitutes a breach of this Agreement 
and grounds for possible suspension or termination of your Service. If 
you have any questions regarding your Service or information in this 
Agreement, you may contact our Customer Care department at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.metropcs.com/">www.metropcs.com</a>, by calling 1-888-8metro8, or by writing us at MetroPCS, P.O. Box 601119, Dallas, Texas 75360-1119.</p>
<p><b>17</b>. *&nbsp;<b>Misuse of Service or Device</b>.&nbsp;<b>By 
activating or renewing Service with MetroPCS, you agree that you do so 
because you want Service from MetroPCS and not for any other purposes. 
You agree not to misuse the Service or Device, including but not limited
 to: (a) reselling or rebilling our Service; (b) using the Service or 
Device to engage in unlawful activity, or in conduct that adversely 
affects our customers, employees, business, or any other person(s), or 
that interferes with our operations, network, reputation, or ability to

 to the Services you purchase; or to protect you, other MetroPCS users, 
MetroPCS and other carriers from fraud, abuse or unlawful use of its

<p><b>27.6&nbsp; Account Activity and Information Verification.&nbsp;</b>This
 Agreement shall be contingent upon our verification and approval of

 provision of Service on the basis of any information that we gather. We
 may require that you provide us with additional or updated information 
we reasonably need to determine if you qualify for Service, to manage 
the Service, or to determine if you are using the Service in accordance 
with this Agreement. If you do not provide us the information we request
 within the time period that we specify, we may choose not to provide 
Service to you, or, if you are an existing customer, we may suspend or 
terminate Service to you. You warrant and represent that all information
 furnished to us by you is current, complete, accurate and true as of 
the time you provide it, and you will update it as necessary to keep it 
complete, accurate, and true. At any time, we may take any action that 
we believe necessary to verify or review your account activity or 
information you provide to us, including: (1) verification of your 
account information; (2) review of your use of Services and of your 
account to help assess the Services we provide and the performance of 
our systems; and (3) investigation of suspected prohibited use or 
violation of this Agreement or the Policies. We may share information we
 gather about you as provided elsewhere in this Agreement and in our 
Privacy Policy which is available at<u>www.metropcs.com</u>&nbsp;or by 
writing to us at the address in Section 16 "Notices". We also may share 
your information, including your personal information and customer 
proprietary network information, with any person who may purchase our 
business.</p>
<p>You (the account holder) may password protect your account 
information by establishing a personal identification number ("PIN"). 
You may also set a backup security question and answer in the event you 
forget your PIN. You agree to protect your PIN, passwords and other 
account access credentials like your backup security question from loss 
or disclosure. It is your sole responsibility to protect your account by
 creating a password that is unknown to any other person. This password 
should never be shared nor should it be written down and kept in a place
 that is accessible to others. Should you feel that your password has 
been compromised you should immediately call MetroPCS to change your 
password. You further agree that MetroPCS may, in our sole discretion, 
treat any person who presents your credentials for account access as you
 or an Authorized User on the account for the purposes of disclosure of 
information or changes in your Rate Plan or Service.</p>
<p><b>27.7&nbsp; Telephone Numbers.</b>&nbsp;We will assign a telephone 
number (the "Number") to your wireless device. You do not own nor have 
any rights to the Number or any personal identification number ("PIN") 
that you may use in connection with your Service, except for any right 
you may have to port the Number to another carrier. We also may assign 
an Internet Protocol address ("IP Address") to your wireless device. You
 do not own or have any rights to the IP Address. We can change, 
reassign, or eliminate any Number or PIN by giving you notice and your 
IP Address without giving you notice. If your account is deactivated, we
 can reassign the Number or IP Address without giving you any notice. 
You may not assign the Number, PIN or IP Address to any wireless device,
 other equipment or to any other party except as approved by us. If you 
assign the Number, PIN or IP Address to any wireless device, other 
equipment or to any other party without our approval, we reserve the 
right to terminate your Service. You can request that we port your 
number to another carrier, and Service for that number will be 
terminated when the porting is complete.&nbsp; If you port your number, 
you will be responsible for all usage and Charges until the port-out is 
complete.&nbsp; If you port a Number to us, please be aware that we may 
not be able to provide some services right away, such as 911 location 
services. You may be required to purchase a new wireless device and you 
may be without Service for some period of time. MetroPCS may charge a 
fee to reimburse MetroPCS for the costs MetroPCS incurs to meet the 
equipment, technology and infrastructure requirements necessary to 
enable number porting. MetroPCS may also charge a fee to reimburse 
MetroPCS for the cost MetroPCS incurs to perform a port. As a standard 
service feature, MetroPCS transmits your Number, account name, and 
address with each call or data session you make from your MetroPCS 
wireless device. Your account name, Number, and IP Address may be 
displayed on the telephone or other device of the party called if that 
person uses caller identification. Your Number and location may also be 
transmitted to public safety officials if you dial 911 or other 
emergency service numbers. Your name and Number for most calls can be 
blocked on a call-by-call basis by dialing *67 before the telephone area
 code and telephone number (on certain devices there may be a different 
number). In addition, you may elect to have your name and Number 
permanently blocked, at no charge, by sending a request in writing to:

<h1><u>MetroPCS Privacy Policy</u></h1>
<p>Published:&nbsp; December 31, 2016</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how information about you is
 collected, used and disclosed by MetroPCS™ and T-Mobile USA, Inc. 
(collectively, "MetroPCS," "we" or "us" or “our”) and provides other 
important privacy information, describes when and how we may change this
 Policy, and tells you how to contact us with any questions or comments.</p>
<p><b><br>
WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</b></p>
<p>We collect information about you and your associated device(s) when 
you use our products or services or otherwise interact with us or with 
third-party services through our products and services. Examples of the 
types of information we collect include:</p>
<p><b>Personal Information</b></p>
<p>“Personal Information” means information that we directly associate 
with a specific person or entity (for example: name; addresses; 
telephone numbers; email address; Social Security Numbers; payment 
information; call records; wireless device location).&nbsp; Personal 
information does not include “de-identified,” “anonymous,” or 
“aggregate” information – which are not associated with a specific 
person or entity.</p>
<p><b>Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)</b></p>
<p>Customer Proprietary Network Information, or "CPNI," is a subset of 
Personal Information that is generated in connection with the 
telecommunications services we provide to you. CPNI includes, for 
example, call details, call location information, and certain 
information about your rate plans and features. CPNI does not include 
your name, address, and phone number.</p>
<p><b>Network and Device Information</b></p>
<p>We may collect information about your use of our network (or other 
carriers’ networks when roaming domestically and internationally) and 
the device(s) associated with your account, network data related to WiFi
 usage and device, and performance information, as well as data relating
 to your use of our website, applications and other products and 
services.</p>
<p><b>Location Data</b></p>
<p>We may collect your device's location whenever it is turned on (subject to coverage limitations).</p>
<p><b>Performance and Diagnostic Data</b></p>
<p>We may collect performance and diagnostic data about your use of our 
network, networks you roam on, WiFi services or your device. For 
example, we may collect information about the performance of the device,
 signal strength, dropped calls, data failures, battery strength and 
other device or network performance issues. We may also collect 
information about applications on your device, the fact that an 
application has been added, when an application is launched or fails to 
launch, and length of time an application has been running.</p>
<p><b>Video Data</b></p>
<p>When you use a video application with your MetroPCS service, for 
example T‑Mobile TV, on your device, we may collect information about 
the programs you watch to determine customer viewing habits so that we 
can tailor video selections to you or our customers.</p>
<p><b>Collection of Information About Children</b></p>
<p>We do not knowingly solicit children to purchase our services or 
products. If, however, you authorize a child to use our services or 
products by providing them a device associated with your account, any 
information associated with such use will be treated as your information
 in accordance with this Policy.</p>
<p>Our websites are not designed to attract children under the age of 13
 and we do not intentionally or knowingly collect Personal Information 
on our websites from anyone under the age of 13.&nbsp; We encourage 
parents to be involved in the online activities (including wireless 
Internet browsing) of their children to ensure that no information is 
collected from a child without parental permission.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>HOW INFORMATION ABOUT YOU IS COLLECTED</b></p>
<p>MetroPCS collects information about you in three primary ways:</p>
<p><b>Information You Provide</b></p>
<p>We collect information that you provide to us when you apply for and 
use or purchase our products or services or otherwise communicate with 
us.</p>
<p>For example, some of the ways you may provide information to us include:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you sign up for our voice or data services or purchase other 
products or services, we may collect personal contact, billing, and 
credit information.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>When you establish or modify an account online, we may collect user 
identification information, passwords, and/or security question 
responses that you will use for future sign-on.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>When you interact with our customer service representatives, enter 
information on our websites, submit survey responses, or pay for 
services, we may also collect Personal Information and other 
information.&nbsp; We may monitor and record phone calls, e-mails, live 
chats, or other communications between you, your device, and our 
Customer Service representatives or other employees or representatives.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Information We Collect</b> <b>Automatically</b></p>
<p>We automatically collect a variety of information associated with your use of your device (on our network, when<i> </i>roaming,<i> </i>or in WiFi mode) and our products and services, some of which may be associated with you.</p>
<p>For example, some of the ways we may automatically collect information include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our systems capture details about the type and location of wireless 
device(s) you use, when the device is turned on, calls and text messages
 you send and receive, and other data services you use.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>We may also gather information about the performance of your device 
and the network. Some examples of the types of data collected include: 
the applications on the device, signal strength, dropped calls, data 
failures, and other device or network performance issues.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><b>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies</b><br>
<br>
We may use, or we may engage third-parties to use on our behalf, cookies
 or similar web tags (small data text files placed on your computer or 
device) or similar technologies to identify your computer or device and 
record your preferences and other data so that our websites can 
personalize your visit(s), see which areas and features of our websites 
are popular, and improve our websites and your experience.<br>
<br>
We may also use web beacons (small graphic images on a web page or an 
HTML e-mail) to monitor interaction with our websites or e-mails. Web 
beacons are generally invisible because they are very small (only 1-by-1
 pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page or e-mail 
message.<br>
<br>
The information we receive through cookies, web beacons and similar 
technologies may enable us to recognize users across devices, such as 
smartphones, computers, tablets or related browsers.&nbsp;Depending upon
 your device or computer, you may be able to set your browser(s) to 
reject cookies or delete cookies, but that may result in the loss of 
some functionality on our websites. If we combine or link cookie or web 
beacon information with Personal Information, we will treat the combined
 or linked information as Personal Information under this Policy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Web Browsing Activity</b><i><br>
 <br>
 Our Websites</i>. When accessing our websites, mobile websites and 
related applications and widgets designed for your device or web-based 
experience, we automatically collect certain information about your 
device and your visit, such as your IP address, browser type, date and 
time, the web page you visited before visiting our website, your 
activities and purchases on our websites, and other analytical 
information associated with the sites.<i><br>
 <br>
 Other Websites</i>.&nbsp; When your device’s web browser utilizes our 
data services to access websites other than our own, we automatically 
capture information associated with your browsing activities, and 
measure and monitor network and Internet connection performance, 
throughput, latency, and similar network data.<br>
<br>
<i>Do Not Track Policy.</i> Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not 
Track” features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal 
or preference to the websites you visit indicating that you do not wish 
to be tracked. Those sites (or the third party content on those sites) 
may continue to engage in activities you might view as tracking even 
though you have expressed this preference, depending on the sites’ 
privacy practices. Because there is not yet a common understanding of 
how to interpret the DNT signal, we do not currently respond to the 
browser DNT signals on when you use our services and products or 
interact with our websites or online services. We do allow you to 
exercise choice regarding the collection of information by third parties
 about your online activities over time and across third-party websites 
or online services for online interest based advertising purposes as 
described <a href="#advertising" adhocenable="false"><u>below</u></a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Voice Controlled Applications</b><br>
If you use a voice-controlled application, that application may collect 
and record your requests and other information from you and your phone.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><b>Retail Beacons</b><br>
We may use beacon devices in our retail locations that collect data 
about your device. These programs use signals from smart devices (like 
mobile phones and tablets) to track movement and wait times. Retail 
beacons collect a unique identifier that your device routinely transmits
 (<i>e.g.</i>, a MAC address) and coverts it to an identifier unique to 
T-Mobile. In some cases, we will use identifiers that are already 
routinely collected by the T-Mobile network in order to provide you with
 wireless service. We use aggregated data in order to understand general
 traffic trends in our stores. This helps us to better service our 
customers.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Information From Other Sources</b></p>
<p>We may also obtain information about you from other sources. For 
example, we may receive credit information from third-party sources 
before initiating your service, and updated address information from our
 shippers or other vendors. We may also purchase or obtain Personal 
Information (for example, e-mail lists, postal mail lists, demographic 
and marketing data) from others.</p>
<p><b>HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</b></p>
<p>We use the information we collect for a variety of business purposes, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>To route your calls or messages or otherwise provide you with service;</li>
<li>To provide and bill for products and services you purchase and charge to your account;</li>
<li>To deliver and confirm products and services you obtain from us;</li>
<li>To verify your identity and maintain a record of your transactions and interactions with us;</li>
<li>To provide customer and technical services to you;</li>
<li>To create, modify, improve, enhance, remove or fix our network, products and services and their performance;</li>
<li>To identify and suggest products or services that might interest you;</li>
<li>To make internal business decisions about current and future product and service offerings;</li>
<li>To provide you customized user experiences, including personalized product and service offerings;</li>
<li>To protect our rights, interests, safety and property and that of our customers, service providers and other third parties; and</li>
<li>To comply with law or as required for legal purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Fraud Prevention</b></p>
<p>We may use Personal Information, including account information (such 
as purchase patterns) and device information for investigations or 
prevention of fraud or network abuse. We provide fraud prevention 
services to banks or other third parties. As part of this service, we 
may verify your phone number to help those third parties prevent your 
personal information from being used for fraudulent purposes. We also 
may provide the information you report as spam to 7726 to a third party 
to prevent fraud or network abuse, and we may share such information 
with government agencies and others that work to combat spam and prevent
 fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair practices.</p>
<p><b>Information Collected from Cookies</b></p>
<p>We may also use information collected from cookies or other similar 
technologies to improve our websites, make recommendations, and complete
 transactions you request.</p>
<p><b>Marketing</b></p>
<p>We may use information we collect to contact you about T-Mobile or 
third-party products, services, and offers that we believe you may find 
of interest. We may contact you by telephone, postal mail, e-mail, or 
other methods. You may opt-out of receiving marketing communications 
from us at any time as outlined below in Choices Regarding Use of Your 
Information.</p>
<p><b>Performance, Diagnostics &amp; Management</b></p>
<p>We collect information about devices, our network and WiFi usage to 
perform diagnostic analyses and understand how your device is performing
 overall.&nbsp; Diagnostic data helps us troubleshoot technical issues 
related to your device’s performance such as battery life, dropped 
calls, processing speed, device memory, service coverage, and network 
and WiFi signal strength that you and other customers may 
experience.&nbsp; If you are using a device in WiFi mode, we may collect
 information about that usage, such as the routing address and IP 
address.&nbsp; We also may use diagnostic data to identify and recommend
 products and services.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a name="location"></a>Location-Based Services</b></p>
<p>We use location information to route wireless communications and to 
provide 911 service, which allows emergency services to locate your 
general location. We may disclose, without your consent, the approximate
 location of a wireless device to a governmental entity or law 
enforcement authority when we are served with lawful process or 
reasonably believe there is an emergency involving risk of death or 
serious physical harm.</p>
<p>Depending on your device, you may also be able to obtain a wide array
 of services based on the location of your device (for example, driving 
directions, enhanced 411 Directory Assistance or search results, etc.). 
These data services, known as Location-Based Services (“LBS”) are made 
available by us and others, usually via applications. These services use
 various location technologies and acquire location data from various 
sources.</p>
<p>These applications and services use various location technologies 
(including Global Positioning Satellite (“GPS”), Assisted GPS (“AGPS”), 
cell ID and enhanced cell ID technologies) to identify the approximate 
location of a device, which is then used in conjunction with the 
application to enhance the user’s experience (for example, to provide 
driving directions, to provide enhanced 411 Directory Assistance or 
search results, etc.)</p>
<p>LBS may, or may not, involve any interaction with or dependency on 
our network, and location-based services may or may not look to our 
network to obtain location data. Where weallow third parties the 
capability of accessing data about your location that is derived from 
our network, we require those third parties to observe specific privacy 
and security protections consistent with this policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is important that you understand the location capabilities and 
settings of your device, and that you carefully read and understand the 
terms under which these services are provided – whether by us or another
 entity.</p>
<p>You should carefully review the privacy policies and other terms of 
third-parties with whom you have authorized the sharing of your location
 information, and you should consider the risks involved in disclosing 
your location information to other people.</p>
<p>Where we provide a location-based service, you will receive notice of
 the location features of the service and collection of location data is
 with your consent. You will be provided options for managing when and 
how such information should be shared. MetroPCS and T-Mobile follow the 
CTIA’s Best Practices Guidelines for Location-Based Services, which are 
available <a adhocenable="false" href="http://www.ctia.org/industry-data/glossary-details/glossary/location-based-services-%28lbs%29"><u>here</u></a>.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Advertising</b></p>
<p>You may see advertisements when you visit our websites, mobile 
websites, in mobile applications, or on your device.&nbsp; We may help 
advertisers better reach our customers by providing certain customer 
information, including device type, geographic information, language 
preferences or demographic information obtained from other 
companies.&nbsp; This information is used by advertisers to determine 
which ads may be more relevant to you.&nbsp; However, we do not share 
Personal Information outside of our corporate family for advertising 
purposes without your consent.&nbsp; Some examples of the types of 
advertising you might see include:</p>
<p><i>OurAds on OurWebsites</i>. We may provide advertisements, such as 
banner ads, on our websites, mobile websites, and in mobile applications
 and widgets you may download, access or use on your device.</p>
<p><i>Other Company Ads on Our Websites</i>. You may also see 
third-party advertisements on some of our websites, services, in 
applications or on devices. These third-party advertisers, or their ad 
networks, may place or access cookies, web beacons, or similar 
technologies on your device and may collect certain anonymous or 
de-identified information about your visit on our websites. The 
third-party advertisers who provide these ads may use this information 
to provide you with advertising on our websites, as well as on other 
websites. We do not have control over or access to any information 
contained in the cookies that are set on your computer or device by ad 
servers, ad networks, or third-party advertisers.</p>
<p><i>Our Ads on Other Websites</i>. We may ask third-parties to place 
advertisements about our products and services on other websites, mobile
 websites and in mobile applications and widgets. The use of cookies, 
web beacons, or similar technologies by such third-parties on other 
websites is subject to any applicable privacy policies that they may 
have, not this Policy.</p>
<p><b><i>Interest-Based Ads</i></b>. You may receive ads from us and our
 ad providers that are tailored to your interests. These interest-based 
ads are selected based on your use of our services and products as well 
as other information obtained by us and our ad providers. None of this 
information is Personal Information.</p>
<ul>
<li>We do not provide your Personal Information to third-party advertisers without your consent.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Advertising may be tailored to the interests that advertisers have 
inferred from your browsing of our websites or other websites or 
applications with which the third-party partners to provide advertising.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>We may provide third-party advertisers with aggregated or 
de-identified location, demographic or similar data (unrelated to your 
browsing activities) that does not personally identify you. This data 
may be used by advertisers to help tailor their ads on our websites, and
 on other sites and applications.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>We, and our providers, may use a de-identified profile of your 
web-browsing and application use activity and interests. This profile 
does not contain information that identifies you personally, but may 
include a unique or encrypted identifier that enables your device to be 
matched to a profile of your browsing activity and de-identified 
characteristics about your interests.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>When we use information associated with your web browsing activities
 on websites that are not our own to provide interest-based advertising 
or offers, we will provide you with notice and appropriate choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information see <u><a href="https://www.metropcs.com/terms-conditions/metropcs-ad-options-for-your-device.html" adhocenable="false">MetroPCS Ad Options for Your Device</a></u></p>
<p><b><i><a name="advertising"></a>Choices about Advertising</i>.</b></p>
<p>MetroPCS adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>On Your Mobile Device</i>. Where we offer interest-based ads, you
 can opt-out of certain interest-based advertising by clicking on the ad
 options link on or near the advertisement or by clicking <a href="http://iba.metropcs.com/" adhocenable="false"><u>here</u></a>.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>If you turn off interest-based ads, you will still see just as many 
ads, but the ads may not be based on your interests and may be less 
relevant to you.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Your choice only affects the ads you see on websites and applications you access on your device.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>If your device’s browser cookies are deleted, or your device is reset, you may need to reset the interest-based ads feature.</li>
<li>If you are using your device, but are not on our network (such as a 
WiFi network), we, and our ad providers, may not be able to identify 
your ad choices.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>On Your Computer or Non-Mobile Device.</i> For information about 
targeted advertising, or to opt-out of use of your browser information 
for purposes of certain third-party advertising, please visit <a adhocenable="false" href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices"><u>www.aboutads.info/choices</u></a>.
 Please note that if you opt out, you will continue to receive the same 
number of ads, but they may be less relevant because they will not be 
based on your interests. You may still see ads related to content on a 
web page or based on other nonpersonal information. Please note that 
this opt-out is cookie-based. If you change computers or devices, change
 web browsers, or delete cookies, you will need to visit the aboutads 
site and opt-out again.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><b>WHEN WE SHARE INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU</b></p>
<p>We do not sell, license, rent, or otherwise provide your Personal 
Information to unaffiliated third-parties (parties outside the T-Mobile 
corporate family) to market their services or products to you without 
your consent. We may, however, disclose your information to unaffiliated
 third-parties as follows:</p>
<p><b>With Your Consent</b></p>
<p>We may disclose Personal Information about you to third-parties with 
your consent. We may obtain your consent in writing; online, through 
"click-through" agreements; when you accept the terms of disclosures on 
your phone for certain applications or services; orally, in our stores 
or on the phone, including through interactive voice response; or 
implicitly, for example, when you purchase a product and ask that it be 
shipped to your home, consenting to our disclosure of your name and 
address to a third-party shipping company to complete delivery.</p>
<p><b>To Others On Your Multiline Account</b></p>
<p>We encourage you not to share your password or pin.&nbsp; If you 
provide your account password or pin number or security question 
responses to third parties, including other line holders on a multiline 
account, they will have access to your personal information – including 
CPNI, such as call detail and service information – when they access 
your account with your account password or pin number.</p>
<p><b>To Our Service Providers</b></p>
<p>We may disclose information to third-party vendors and partners who 
complete transactions or perform services on our behalf (for example, 
credit/debit card processing, billing, shipping, repair, customer 
service, auditing, and marketing).</p>
<p><b>Third-Party Carriers and Suppliers</b></p>
<p>If you are roaming on the network of another carrier or WiFi service 
provider, your wireless telephone number, your location, the numbers you
 dial, and other information about your usage will be available to that 
carrier to facilitate that service.</p>
<p><b>In a Business Transfer</b></p>
<p>We may sell, disclose, or transfer information about you as part of a
 corporate business transaction, such as a merger or acquisition, joint 
venture, corporate reorganization, financing, or sale of company assets,
 or in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, in
 which such information could be transferred to third-parties as a 
business asset in the transaction.</p>
<p><b>For Legal Process &amp; Protection</b></p>
<p>We may disclose Personal Information, and other information about 
you, or your communications, where we have a good faith belief that 
access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is 
reasonably necessary:</p>
<ul>
<li>to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request;</li>
<li>to enforce or apply agreements, or initiate, render, bill, and 
collect for services and products (including to collection agencies in 
order to obtain payment for our products and services);</li>
<li>to protect our rights or interests, or property or safety or that of others;</li>
<li>in connection with claims, disputes, or litigation – in court or elsewhere;</li>
<li>to protect users of our services and other carriers or providers 
from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription to, such 
services;</li>
<li>When information is reported to the Spam Reporting Service, it may 
be shared with government agencies and others that work to combat spam 
and prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair practices.</li>
<li>to facilitate or verify the appropriate calculation of taxes, fees, 
or other obligations due to a local, state, or federal government; or</li>
<li>in an emergency situation.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Co-Sponsored Websites and Partners</b></p>
<p>If you provide information to us in connection with a co-sponsored 
website, this Policy will apply to our use of the information and the 
co-sponsor’s policy will apply to their use of the information.&nbsp; If
 you purchase equipment or activate service at one of our partner 
locations (including websites of such dealer or retailer), they may 
request information from you that is passed to us as part of the 
activation process, but which may also be retained by the partner.&nbsp;
 This Policy will govern our treatment of such information, and the 
partner’s privacy policy will govern its use of such information.</p>
<p><b>De-Identified Information</b></p>
<p>We may provide information that does not identify you personally to third-parties for marketing, advertising or other purposes.</p>

&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="_msocom_1"></a><b>Third-Party Applications for Your Devices</b></p>
<p>We are not responsible for the third-party applications (for example,
 applications, programs, widgets, etc.) you select and install on your 
device.&nbsp; When you install third-party applications, you may give 
your consent for the third party to access information stored on the 
device and our network to facilitate the application’s functions (for 
example, you may consent to third-party access to your location 
information – <i>see</i> <b><a href="#location" adhocenable="false"><u>Location Based Services</u></a></b>).&nbsp;
 The manner in which such third-parties may use, share, or disclose such
 information would be governed by the terms and conditions and privacy 
policy provided by that third party – not by this Policy.</p>
<p><b>Directories</b></p>
<p>We do not publish directories of our customers’ wireless numbers; nor
 will we provide or make such numbers available to third-parties for 
listing in their public directories, without the customer’s prior 
consent.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>HOW WE STORE AND PROTECT THE INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU</b></p>
<p><b>Protecting Your Information</b></p>
<p>We use a variety of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards 
to protect Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or 
disclosure while it is under our control.</p>
<p>Under federal law, you have a right, and we have a duty, to protect 
the confidentiality of CPNI and we have adopted policies and procedures 
designed to ensure compliance with those rules. We will not 
intentionally disclose your CPNI to third-parties without your 
permission, except as allowed under FCC rules, applicable law, or 
explained in this Policy.</p>
<p><b>Retention and Disposal</b></p>
<p>We retain information only for as long as we have a business or tax 
need or as applicable laws, regulations, or government orders allow. 
When we dispose of Personal Information, we use reasonable procedures 
designed to erase or render it unreadable (for example, shredding 
documents and wiping electronic media).<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>HOW YOU CAN UPDATE YOUR INFORMATION AND CHOOSE HOW WE CONTACT YOU</b></p>
<p><b>Access to Your Information</b></p>
<p>You may access and modify your contact information at a MetroPCS 
retail store, or by contacting us using the information in the “How to 
Contact Us” section below. You may also modify some information on 
through MyAccount.</p>
<p><b>Choices Regarding Use of Your Information</b></p>
<p>We may send you communications about services or products we, or our 
partners, sell.&nbsp; We want to provide you with meaningful choices 
regarding our marketing communications and you may choose to limit or 
opt-out of marketing communications from us at any time. Although you 
may elect not to receive marketing information from us, if you subscribe
 to our services or buy our products, you will continue to receive 
customer-service and transactional notices, and similar communications.</p>
<p>You may manage your marketing preferences by contacting MetroPCS 
Customer Service at 1- 888-863-8768 from any phone, or, with respect to 
marketing e-mails and text messages, by following the “unsubscribe” 
instructions on any marketing e-mail we send you, or by managing your 
preferences in MyAccount online.</p>
<p><b>Do Not Call Registry</b></p>
<p>The FTC maintains a National Do Not Call Registry at <a href="https://www.donotcall.gov/"><u>https://www.donotcall.gov/</u></a>,
 and your state may maintain its own Do Not Call Registry.&nbsp; Putting
 your number on these Registries also may limit our telemarketing calls 
to that number.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>YOUR ROLE IN PROTECTING YOUR PRIVACY</b></p>
<p><b>Protecting Your Personal Information</b></p>
<p>You play an important role in ensuring the security of Personal 
Information. We encourage you to use passwords or PIN to prevent 
unauthorized access to your device, your online account, and your 
voicemail. You may also establish an optional password to identify 
yourself during calls with our Customer Service representatives. We 
recommend that you use unique, non-obvious passwords, that you 
periodically change your passwords, and that you not share your 
passwords with others.</p>
<p>Many devices store information in the device’s memory, on the SIM 
card, and/or on SD memory cards. Therefore, before selling, discarding, 
trading in, or giving away your device, be sure you remove and retain 
your SIM and SD memory card and follow the manufacturer's instructions 
for deleting Personal Information or other data on the device. (This can
 be found in your owner's manual or on the manufacturer’s web site.)</p>
<p><b>Lost or Stolen Devices</b></p>
<p>In order to protect you, please notify us immediately by calling 
Customer Care at 1- 888-863-8768 if you believe your device has been 
lost or stolen or if you believe your Personal Information has been 
accessed without your consent.</p>
<p><b>Limit Third-Party Access</b></p>
<p>If you provide a third-party with access to your device, or share 
your password or PIN, you should understand that your Personal 
Information may be accessed, deleted, altered, or transferred to another
 device or our network servers by the person using the device, and that 
we will treat that user as you for purposes of this Policy.</p>
<p><b>Caller ID Blocking</b></p>
<p>When you use MetroPCS communications services, your name and/or 
telephone number may be transmitted and displayed on the receiving 
party’s communications device and/or phone bill unless you block that 
information, which you can generally do by dialing *67 prior to dialing 
the called party’s number. Refer to the specific instructions for your 
communication device regarding Caller ID Blocking. Caller ID Blocking 
does not prevent the display of your information when you dial certain 
business numbers, including 911, 900 numbers, or toll-free numbers.</p>
<p><b>Social Networking, Forums and Chat Rooms</b></p>
<p>If you use or link to a public forum, bulletin board, chat room, or 
social network on or from a MetroPCS web site, be aware that any 
information you post or submit can be read, collected, or used by other 
users of these forums, including to send you unsolicited messages. We 
urge you not to share your Personal Information (for example, your name,
 phone numbers, addresses, passwords or PIN, etc.) on these 
websites.&nbsp; We are not responsible for access to or use of 
information you choose to submit or share with others. For example, if 
you post your wireless number on a social network in order to receive 
updates by text message, standard message charges will apply to such 
messages.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>OTHER INFORMATION YOU SHOULD KNOW</b></p>
<p><b>Consumer Code for Wireless Service</b></p>
<p>We follow the <u><a href="http://www.ctia.org/policy-initiatives/voluntary-guidelines/consumer-code-for-wireless-service" adhocenable="false">Consumer Code for Wireless Service</a></u>
 established by the Cellular Telecommunications &amp; Internet 
Association (“CTIA”). In doing so, we want to help customers understand 
their bills, receive quality service, and make informed choices and 
conform our information practices under this Policy to meet the 
requirements of applicable federal and state laws and regulations.</p>
<p><b>Your California Privacy Rights</b></p>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798 entitles California customers to 
request information concerning whether a business has disclosed Personal
 Information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct 
marketing purposes.&nbsp; As stated in this Policy, we will not sell or 
share your Personal Information with non-affiliated companies for their 
direct marketing purposes without your consent.&nbsp; California 
customers who wish to request further information about our compliance 
with this law or have questions or concerns about our privacy practices 
and policies may contact us as specified in the “How to Contact Us” 
section below.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>PRIVACY POLICY UPDATES AND CONTACT INFORMATION</b></p>
