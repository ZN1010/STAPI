<h2>Cookies and other tracking tools</h2>
<h2>KAYAK uses tracking tools such as cookies</h2>
<p>We (or our suppliers) use several common tracking tools. We use these tools to collect usage and demographic information about you over time and across different Web sites when you use our Platforms. We also have third parties (e.g. advertisers) that collect personal information this way. Tools we use may include browser cookies. Your browser will store these cookies on your computer in a small file.</p>
<p>We and our advertising partners may also use web beacons (single pixel GIF images). These web beacons are placed in the code of a Web page or an email newsletter. When you access a partner site within our mobile applications, we may track your activity on that site.</p>
<p>By using the Platforms, you give us your free, unambiguous and informed consent to the use of any of the cookies and tracking tools mentioned in this policy.</p>
<h2>KAYAK uses tracking tools for following purposes</h2>
<p>(i) To track new visitors to the Platforms.</p>
<p>(ii) To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor. This includes saving and remembering any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting the Platforms, such as language.</p>
<p>(iii) To store your username and password if you are registered with us.</p>
<p>(iv) To work with online advertising companies to display targeted advertising on our Platforms and third party platforms that you visit. This targeting may be based on information you submit on our Platforms or third party platforms. This targeting may also be based on your activities or behaviors on our Platforms or those of third parties. We may also obtain information about your browsing history from our business partners. To learn more about targeted advertising and how you can accept or refuse (opt-out of) this type of advertisements, we recommend that you visit www.aboutads.info/choices or www.youronlinechoices.eu.</p>
<p>(v) To track when you book on partner websites.</p>
<p>(vi) To help improve our website offering and for capacity planning purposes. We or our third party service providers may set analytics cookies. These allow us to gather aggregated or segmented information about the types of visitors that access our Platforms and the pages and advertisements that they view. In order to better understand your use of our Platforms, we or our third party service providers may collect information on such use, including pages visited, links clicked and mouse movements. We do not use this information to personally identify you.</p>
<h2>How you can control tracking tools and opt-out of online behavioral advertising</h2>
<p>Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How to do this varies from browser to browser. You should view the Help menu on the browser you use for further information.</p>
<p>To opt out of having your online behavior tracked by KAYAK for advertising purposes click here; this means that KAYAK will no longer use information derived from your online behavior, collected by KAYAK or third parties acting on behalf of KAYAK, for the purpose of providing you interest-based advertising from KAYAK only. Note that opting out of receiving interest-based advertising through the link above does not mean you will no longer receive advertising from KAYAK or third parties at all; rather it means that most of the advertising that you will see will not be based on your particular interest. In addition, KAYAK may still collect information for other purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. Your opt out choice is stored in opt out cookies only in this browser, so you should separately set your preferences for other browsers, computers, or devices you may use. If your browser blocks cookies, your opt out preferences may not be effective. Deleting browser cookies can remove your opt out preferences, so you should visit this page periodically to review your preferences.</p>
<p>We may also use Google Analytics to collect demographic and interest data about you (such as age, gender, and interests), including through Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. You can find out more about Google Analytics and how to opt-out by going here. Choices you make are browser and device specific. Some aspects of our site use cookies to function. You may not be able to use these features if you set your device to block cookies. If you block or delete cookies or opt out of online behavioral advertising, not all of the tracking that we have described in this policy will stop.</p>
<h2>How KAYAK responds to “Do Not Track” signals</h2>
<p>Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.</p>
<p>If you have any questions on our use of tracking tools, please use the feedback form.</p>
