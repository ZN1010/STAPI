<h2>CHILDREN & PRIVACY</h2>
<p>It is important to us that children can enjoy our website in a responsible fashion.

These tools can also prevent children from disclosing online their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission.</p>
<p>Your child's privacy is important to us. We are committed to safeguarding children's personal information collected online, and to helping parents and guardians and their children learn how to exercise control over personal information while exploring the Internet.</p>
