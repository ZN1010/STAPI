<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<div>As a valued Customer, you are entitled to your personal privacy. With that in mind, Greyhound has adopted a Privacy Policy (“Policy”) which explains and confirms our commitment to provide you with a variety of travel services while maintaining your personal privacy.</div>
<h2>PRIVACY</h2>
<h2>Sharing & Disclosure of Personal Information</h2>
<p>Greyhound will never sell your personal or financial information to any third party. Your personal and/or financial information, however, may be shared with third parties, who are authorized by Greyhound for the following purposes:</p>
<p>Credit card verification, processing and fraud detection purposes as part of your ticket purchase; and/or</p>
<p>Legal disclosure to a governmental agency, law enforcement or court as required by law in the good faith belief that disclosure is necessary or advisable.</p>
<p>Greyhound uses third party payment processing companies to bill you for goods and services, or for other purposes within the ordinary course of business. We make these companies commit to contract (1) to provide protections for your personally identifiable information that are no less protective than those set out in this Policy, and (2) to use your personally identifying information only for the purposes for which the third party has been engaged by Greyhound. Greyhound is not liable for the acts or omissions of these third parties except to the extent required by applicable law.</p>
<p>In addition, if you decide to participate in our marketing programs (including but not limited to customer loyalty, incentives, affinity, promotions or contests), your non-financial personal information may be released to reputable third parties in order to fulfill certain business requirements of those programs.</p>
<p>We may also share information that we collect in the aggregate with third parties, including, without limitation, our marketing partners.</p>
<h2>Personal Information Collected For Processing Transactions</h2>
<p>Greyhound collects personal information (name, address, phone number, etc.) as well as a credit card number to process transactions. An e-mail address for an online purchase is optional; however, your e-mail address is required for Print at Home purchases and if you would like a copy of your confirmation statement e-mailed to you. We use the information we collect during the purchase process for billing purposes, to fill your orders, for administrative, analytical, correspondence, and operational purposes, to customize advertisements and offers and for other marketing purposes, and for other purposes discussed in this Policy.</p>
<h2>Marketing Programs</h2>
<p>Greyhound collects personal information including email addresses and telephone numbers to facilitate our marketing programs and communicate with customers who have expressed an interest in upcoming specials, discounts, and helpful travel tips. Often this information is collected on web sites that are hosted by companies associated with Greyhound. </p>
<p>By participating in our marketing programs, you agree to honor and abide by the rules and regulations contained therein. Please read all rules before participating.</p>
<p>Greyhound takes no responsibility for the specific privacy rules or terms and conditions of the contest sponsors or other third parties and we encourage you to examine the privacy policies contained on these sites.</p>
<h2>Road Rewards Program</h2>

Electing to establish a Road Rewards account will enroll you in the Greyhound frequent rider program and give you the opportunity to earn rewards. You will not be able to earn points toward reward trips if you elect to not sign up for this program. As a Road Rewards Member, you may also receive special offers by e-mail simply for being a Member of the Road Rewards program.</p>
<p>We may use the personally identifiable information you provide when you become a Road Rewards Member for analytical, administrative, marketing, correspondence or other operational or business purposes.

<p>Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
