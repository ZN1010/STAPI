<h2>Customer Privacy Policy</h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Tesla, Inc. and its affiliates (“Tesla”) respect your concerns about privacy. This Privacy Policy explains Tesla’s policies and procedures regarding information we collect from or about our customers and their use of our products and services. Tesla intends to provide you with a level of comfort and confidence in how we collect, use, share, and safeguard information that we collect. This Privacy Policy also explains how you can contact us if you have any questions or concerns. By providing information to us or by using our products or services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>Information We May Collect</h2>
<p>We collect three main types of information related to you or your use of our products and services: (1) information from or about you or your devices; (2) information from or about your Tesla vehicle; and (3) information from or about your Tesla energy products. Depending on the Tesla products and services you request, own, or use, not all of these types of information may be applicable to you.</p>
<h2>From or about you or your devices</h2>
<p>We may collect information from or about you (such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail, payment information, etc.) or your devices in a variety of ways, including:</p>
<p>Through the Services: We may collect information from or about you through our websites, software applications, social media pages, e-mail messages, or other digital services (the “Services”), e.g., when you sign up for a newsletter, make a purchase, or register your product with us.</p>
<p>From other sources: We also may receive information about you from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, certified installers, third-party vehicle repair or service centers, and social media platforms.</p>
<p>Tesla Account: Customers who purchase certain Tesla products will receive a Tesla Account, which is hosted on our website. We may collect and process the following types of data for your Tesla Account that you elect to provide to us: your customer registration information; the status of your order; warranty and other documentation for your Tesla products; and general information about your Tesla products (including, for example, vehicle identification number or other product serial number, service plan information, or connectivity package), insurance forms, driver’s licenses, financing agreements, and similar information. You can access your Tesla Account to update the information from or about you in that account at any time.</p>
<p>Offline: We may collect information from or about you offline, such as when you visit a Tesla store or repair facility, attend one of our events, sign up for a test drive, place an order over the phone, or contact our customer services or sales department.</p>
<p>Through your browser or device: Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version, and the name and version of the Services (such as the Tesla App) you are using. We use this information to ensure that the Services function properly.</p>
<p>When you visit our website or otherwise use our Services, we may use cookies, pixel tags, analytics tools, and other similar technologies to help provide and improve our Services, and as detailed below:</p>
<p>Cookies: Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using. Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Services, pages visited, language preferences, and other web traffic data. Our service providers and we use the information for security purposes, to facilitate online navigation, to display information more effectively, to personalize your experience while using the Services, and to otherwise analyze user activity. We can recognize your computer to assist your use of the Services. We also gather statistical information about the usage of the Services in order to continually improve their design and functionality, understand how the Services are used, and assist us with resolving questions regarding the Services. Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and to display them to you. We may also use cookies in online advertising to see how you interact with our advertisements, and we may use cookies or other files to understand your use of other websites.</p>
<p>If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies when using your Tesla Account or our website, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or gives you the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site. You may also wish to refer to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html. However, if you do not accept these cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer, and you may need to log in every time you visit the applicable Services.</p>
<p>Pixel tags and other similar technologies: Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used in connection with some Services to, among other things, track the actions of users of the Services (including e-mail recipients), measure the success of our marketing campaigns, and compile statistics about usage of the Services and response rates.</p>
<p>Analytics tools: We use website and application analytics services provided by third parties that use cookies and other similar technologies to collect information about website or application use and to report trends, without identifying individual visitors. The third parties that provide us with these services may also collect information about your use of third-party websites.</p>
<p>You can learn about Google’s practices in connection with this information collection and how to opt out of it by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</p>
<h2>From or about your Tesla vehicle</h2>
<p>We may collect a variety of information from or about your Tesla vehicle, including:</p>
<p>Telematics log data: To improve our vehicles and services for you, we may collect certain telematics data regarding the performance, usage, operation, and condition of your Tesla vehicle, including the following: e.g., vehicle identification number; speed information; odometer readings; battery use management information; battery charging history; electrical system functions; software version information; infotainment system data; safety-related data and camera images (including, e.g., information regarding the vehicle’s SRS systems, braking and acceleration, security, e-brake, and accidents); short video clips of accidents; information regarding the use and operation of Autopilot, Summon, and other features; and other data to assist in identifying issues and analyzing the performance of the vehicle. We may collect such information either in person (such as during a service appointment) or via remote access.</p>
<p>Remote analysis data: We may be able to dynamically connect to your Tesla vehicle to diagnose and resolve issues with it, and this process may result in access to personal settings in the vehicle (such as contacts, browsing history, navigation history, and radio listening history). This dynamic connection also enables us to view the current location of your vehicle, but such access is restricted to a limited number of personnel within Tesla.</p>
<p>Other vehicle data: In order to help improve our products and services, we may collect and store other vehicle data, such as: data about accidents involving your Tesla vehicle (e.g., air bag deployment and other recent sensor data); data about remote services (e.g., remote lock/unlock, start/stop charge, and honk-the-horn commands); a data report to confirm that your vehicle is online together with information about the current software version and certain telematics data; vehicle connectivity information; data about any issues that could materially impair operation of your vehicle; data about any safety-critical issues; and data about each software and firmware update. We may collect such information either in person (e.g., during a service appointment) or via remote access.</p>
<p>Service history: In order to facilitate the servicing of your car, we may collect and process data about the service history of each Tesla vehicle, including, e.g., the customer’s name, vehicle identification number, repair history, any outstanding recalls, any bills due, any customer complaints, and any other information related to its service history.</p>
<p>Charging station information: We may collect information regarding the charge rate and charging stations used by you (including outlets) in order to, e.g., analyze which charging stations are being utilized, how long and efficient battery charges are, and where additional charging stations are needed.</p>
<p>Advanced features:</p>
<p>We may provide you with features in your Tesla vehicle, such as the real-time traffic feature, Autopilot, Summon, or other features which make use of the road segment data of your vehicle, and we may share this data with partners that contribute similar data to help us provide the service. We also may collect similar data in connection with other features and may share it with business partners where necessary to provide the feature to you, but we will only collect and share the data in a way that does not personally identify you. We also only collect and share this data if these features are enabled in your vehicle, though your vehicle may send this data to Tesla and its partners even if you are not actively using a feature that needs this information. You can enable or disable the collection and sharing of this data at any time via the “DATA SHARING” setting in Controls > Settings > Safety & Security.</p>
<p>To further help develop and improve autonomous safety features, we may collect short video clips using the car’s external cameras to learn how to recognize things like lane lines, street signs, and traffic light positions. These short video clips are not linked to your vehicle identification number and we have ensured that there is no way to search our system for clips that are associated with a specific car. You can enable or disable the collection of these clips any time via the “DATA SHARING” setting in Controls > Settings > Safety & Security.</p>
<p>If you no longer wish us to collect Telematics Log Data or any other data from your Tesla vehicle, please contact us as indicated in the “How to Contact Us” section below. Please note that, if you opt out from the collection of Telematics Log Data or any other data from your Tesla vehicle (with the exception of the Data Sharing setting detailed above), we will not be able to notify you of issues applicable to your vehicle in real time, and this may result in your vehicle suffering from reduced functionality, serious damage, or inoperability, and it may also disable many features of your vehicle including periodic software and firmware updates, remote services, and interactivity with mobile applications and in-car features such as location search, Internet radio, voice commands, and web browser functionality.</p>

<h2>Patent Pledge</h2>
<p>On June 12, 2014, Tesla announced that it will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use its technology. Tesla was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport, and this policy is intended to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting Tesla, other companies making electric vehicles, and the world. These guidelines provide further detail as to how we are implementing this policy.</p>
<h2>Tesla’s Pledge</h2>
<p>Tesla irrevocably pledges that it will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing a Tesla Patent through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith. Key terms of the Pledge are explained below.</p>
<h2>Definition of Key Terms</h2>
<p>"Tesla Patents" means all patents owned now or in the future by Tesla (other than a patent owned jointly with a third party or any patent that Tesla later acquires that comes with an encumbrance that prevents it from being subject to this Pledge). A list of Tesla Patents subject to the Pledge will be maintained at the following URL: https://www.tesla.com/about/legal#patent-list.</p>
<p>A party is "acting in good faith" for so long as such party and its related or affiliated companies have not:</p>
<p>asserted, helped others assert or had a financial stake in any assertion of (i) any patent or other intellectual property right against Tesla or (ii) any patent right against a third party for its use of technologies relating to electric vehicles or related equipment;</p>
<p>challenged, helped others challenge, or had a financial stake in any challenge to any Tesla patent; or</p>
<p>marketed or sold any knock-off product (e.g., a product created by imitating or copying the design or appearance of a Tesla product or which suggests an association with or endorsement by Tesla) or provided any material assistance to another party doing so.</p>
<h2>Transfer of Tesla Patents</h2>
<p>Should Tesla ever transfer a Tesla Patent to a third party, it will do so only to a party that agrees, by means of a public declaration intended to be binding on such party, to provide the same protection that Tesla provided under the Pledge and to place the same requirement on any subsequent transferee.</p>
<h2>Legal Effect</h2>
<p>The Pledge, which is irrevocable and legally binding on Tesla and its successors, is a "standstill," meaning that it is a forbearance of enforcement of Tesla’s remedies against any party for claims of infringement for so long as such party is acting in good faith. In order for Tesla to preserve its ability to enforce the Tesla Patents against any party not acting in good faith, the Pledge is not a waiver of any patent claims (including claims for damages for past acts of infringement) and is not a license, covenant not to sue, or authorization to engage in patented activities or a limitation on remedies, damages or claims. Except as expressly stated in the Pledge, no rights shall be deemed granted, waived or received by implication, exhaustion, estoppel or otherwise. Finally, the Pledge is not an indication of the value of an arms-length, negotiated license or a reasonable royalty.</p>
<p>What this pledge means is that as long as someone uses our patents for electric vehicles and doesn’t do bad things, such as knocking off our products or using our patents and then suing us for intellectual property infringement, they should have no fear of Tesla asserting its patents against them.</p>

<h2>Pay Per Use</h2>
<p>All vehicles ordered after January 15, 2017, and vehicles ordered by January 15, 2017 but built after April 15, 2017, are enabled for Supercharging on a pay per use basis. Any credits for free Supercharging that are given with the purchase of a vehicle, including any annual renewal of credits, expire upon the sale or transfer of the vehicle and are not transferable to any subsequent vehicle owner, or to any other vehicle. Credits for Supercharging expire after a set period of time and do not rollover into future periods.</p>
<p>Pay per use billing is on a per kilowatt hour basis in jurisdictions where this is feasible, and as a service fee on a per minute basis in other jurisdictions. The pay per use billing unit and rate for each location may change from time to time, and the latest information is provided in the map pin pop-up (accessible through the navigation application on your vehicle touchscreen) or on a sign at the Supercharger location, and on our webpage. For additional information, please see our Supercharger support page and address other inquiries to ServiceHelpNA@tesla.com.</p>
<h2>Supercharger Fair Use Policy</h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We are continually expanding our global network of Supercharger stations to enable personal long distance travel and to provide a charging solution for those without immediate access to home or workplace charging, thereby accelerating the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. When Superchargers are used beyond their intended purpose, it negatively impacts the availability of Supercharging services for others.</p>
<h2>Supercharger Fair Use</h2>
<p>To help ensure that Superchargers are available for their intended use, we ask that you not charge your vehicle using a Supercharger if your vehicle is being used:</p>
<p>as a taxi;</p>
<p>for ridesourcing or ridesharing (through Uber, Lyft or similar services);</p>
<p>to commercially deliver or transport goods;</p>
<p>for government purposes; or</p>
<p>for any other commercial venture.</p>
<p>If you charge your vehicle in a manner that does not comply with this Supercharger Fair Use Policy, we may ask you to modify this behavior. We may also take additional action to protect the availability of Superchargers for their intended purpose, such as limiting or blocking your vehicle’s ability to use Supercharger stations.</p>
<p>This Policy applies to all Superchargers worldwide and all Tesla vehicles purchased, either new or used, whether from Tesla or a third party, after December 15, 2017. Tesla may choose to exclude certain Supercharger stations or occasional trips from the scope of this Policy, such as to accommodate specific local circumstances.</p>

<h2>Tesla’s Supplier Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>Download PDF</p>
<div>Last Updated June 2017</div>
<h2>Human Rights And Conflict Minerals Policy</h2>
<p>Tesla expects our suppliers to conduct their worldwide operations in responsible manner in adherence of this policy and the principles enumerated herein. Tesla works collaboratively with our suppliers to encourage compliance with the following principles:</p>
<h2>Legal And Regulatory Compliance</h2>
<p>Tesla suppliers are to ensure their operations and the products and services supplied to Tesla comply with all national and other applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<h2>Conflict Minerals</h2>
<p>Tesla's suppliers are expected to use reasonable efforts to ensure that parts and products supplied to Tesla are DRC "conflict-free," meaning that such conflict minerals do not benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Conflict-free means such parts and supplies do not contain metals derived from "conflict minerals" which are defined as:</p>
<p>The goal of this policy is to ensure that Tesla's products do not directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups through mining or mineral trading in the DRC and adjoining countries. Tesla requires its suppliers to establish policies, due diligence frameworks, and management systems, consistent with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas, that are designed to accomplish this goal. Tesla expects its suppliers to stay up-to-date with and to use validated conflict free smelters and refiners assessed by the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative and similar organizations. Tesla performs ongoing due diligence and files annual reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.</p>
<h2>Human Rights</h2>
<p>Tesla is committed to ensuring that its suppliers do not use slave or child labor or engage in human trafficking. Tesla does not, and will not, tolerate the use of slave or child labor in the manufacture of its products and does not, and will not, accept products or services from suppliers that engage in human trafficking in any form. Human trafficking, child labor and slavery are crimes under state, federal and international law. These crimes exist in countries throughout the world.</p>
<h2>Supplier Compliance</h2>
<p>Tesla will do the following to ensure compliance by its suppliers with this policy as required by law and as needed:</p>
<p>Evaluate its supply chain to address risks related to conflict minerals, human trafficking, slavery and child labor;</p>
<p>Audit suppliers, to evaluate supplier compliance with Tesla's Human Rights and Conflict Minerals Policy;</p>
<p>Require direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into Tesla products comply with the laws regarding conflict minerals, slavery, child labor and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business;</p>
<p>Discipline employees or contractors, including potential termination of contract, who fail to meet Tesla's Human Rights and Conflict Minerals Policy;</p>
<p>Train certain Tesla employees regarding conflict minerals, human trafficking, child labor and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the Tesla's supply chain;</p>
<p>Investigate if Tesla has a reasonable basis to believe that a Tesla supplier is engaging in human trafficking, slave or child labor, or use of conflict minerals; and</p>
<p>Transition away from purchasing goods or services from any supplier that is believed to be engaging in human trafficking, slave or child labor, or use of conflict minerals if the supplier does not take corrective actions within a reasonable period of time.</p>
<h2>Grievance Mechanism</h2>
<p>You may contact Tesla's Board of Directors to provide comments or to report concerns. Please write to:</p>
<p>Corporate Secretary</p>
<p>Tesla</p>

<h2>Tesla Conflict Minerals Report</h2>
<p>* This report has been filed to comply with the reporting period for the year ended December 31, 2016.</p>
<h2>Tesla's mission</h2>
<p>The goal of Tesla is to accelerate world’s transition to sustainable energy.</p>
<h2>Overview of Tesla</h2>
<p>We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, energy storage systems, and solar energy systems.</p>
<h2>Tesla's Supply Chain</h2>
<p>Our products use thousands of purchased parts which we source globally from hundreds of suppliers.</p>
<p>Tesla is committed to only sourcing responsibly produced materials. Tesla has a Human Rights and Conflict Minerals policy that outlines our expectations to all suppliers and partners that work with us. We strictly follow all U.S. and foreign law, and require our supply chain to do the same. All of our contracts require suppliers to adhere to our human rights policy and environmental and safety requirements. Tesla is committed to making working conditions in Tesla’s supply chain safe and humane, ensuring that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible. Tesla suppliers are required to provide evidence of the existence of policies that address these social, environmental, and sustainability issues as well as responsible sourcing.</p>
<p>Our complex supply chain is a unique hybrid of the traditional automotive and high tech industries and encompasses suppliers from around the world. Many of our Tier 1 suppliers (i.e., direct suppliers) do not purchase all their raw materials directly and instead obtain them from downstream suppliers and sub-suppliers. Therefore, reliably determining the origin is a difficult task.</p>
<p>Our Tier 1 suppliers are required to register and complete the domestic and international material compliance requirements in the International Material Data System (“IMDS”) to meet European Union and other international material and environmental related regulations. This requirement is mandated for all suppliers who supply their products or raw materials to us as part of our production part approval process.</p>
<p>Supplier-provided data collected via the IMDS process is the starting point for our conflict minerals due diligence efforts. In addition to the material requirements above, we refined our sourcing process to require our Tier 1 suppliers to fully disclose material sourcing of certain materials as specified in supply chain purchasing contracts.</p>
<h2>Ensuring Supplier Compliance</h2>
<p>As part of ensuring supplier compliance to conflict minerals due diligence, we released a human rights and conflict minerals policy in 2013 and updated it in 2015. Tesla is committed to sourcing responsibly and considers mining activities that fuel conflict as unacceptable. Tesla’s suppliers are expected to use reasonable efforts to ensure that parts and products supplied to Tesla are DRC “conflict-free,” meaning that such conflict minerals do not benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Conflict-free means such parts and supplies do not contain metals derived from "conflict minerals" which are defined as:</p>
<p>The goal of this policy is to ensure that Tesla's products do not directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups through mining or mineral trading in the DRC and adjoining countries. Tesla requires its suppliers to establish policies, due diligence frameworks, and management systems consistent with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. Tesla expects its suppliers to stay up-to-date with and to use validated conflict free smelters and refiners assessed by the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative and similar organizations. Tesla performs ongoing due diligence and files annual reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. For more information regarding Tesla’s Human Rights and Conflict Minerals Policy, visit http://www.tesla.com/about/legal.</p>
<p>Tesla’s Conflicts Mineral Policy also includes a grievance mechanism where concerned parties may contact Tesla’s Board of Directors and provide comments about Conflict Minerals and other sourcing matters.</p>
<h2>The Recognized Framework used to develop Due Diligence Framework</h2>
<p>Our conflict minerals process and policy are designed to conform in all material respects with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (“OECD Guidance”).</p>
<h2>Description of Due Diligence Performed on the Source and Chain of Custody of those Conflict Minerals</h2>
<h2>Step 1: Establish strong company management systems</h2>
<p>As noted above, Tesla has adopted a human rights and conflict minerals policy. The policy was reviewed and updated in December 2015. Our supplier manuals also address conflict minerals and state our expectation that all Tesla suppliers are accountable for performing due diligence on their mineral supply chains in accordance with the OECD Guidance. Our contractual terms with suppliers (i.e., General Terms and Conditions) include verbiage that provides the expectation that all Tesla suppliers are accountable for performing conflict minerals due diligence aligned with the OECD Guidance as required by Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.</p>
<p>We maintain a small team within our supply chain personnel to lead the due diligence efforts. Our internal cross-functional “Steering Committee” composed of Tesla management from Supply Chain, Accounting and Legal oversees the due diligence efforts and potential risks and issues within our supply base. We use the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative (“CFSI”) Reporting Template (“CMRT”) to query at risk Tier 1 suppliers to identify smelters in congruence with the OECD Guidance.</p>
<p>We are using the automotive industry standard International Material Data System (“IMDS”) to help determine which suppliers are at risk for conflict minerals for all Tesla products. From that database, we review the existing supplier base annually to include newly added suppliers and existing suppliers who provide products to Tesla, to determine which Tier 1 suppliers are likely to supply a product with Gold, Tantalum, Tin, Tungsten, or “3TG”. For any Tier 1 supplier which has products that are determined to be highly unlikely to provide 3TG, we do not pursue additional conflict minerals due diligence and do not include that supplier in the Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry (“RCOI”).</p>
<h2>Step 2: Identify and assess risk in the supply chain</h2>
<p>We sent out an inquiry letter to the Tier 1 suppliers which have products not determined to be “highly unlikely” to provide 3TG based on our data analysis from IMDS. Suppliers were given approximately one month to respond to this letter and submit their CMRT. Any suppliers that did not respond were queried again. We continually reached out to in-scope suppliers on a monthly basis towards the end of 2016 to receive the most up-to-date report.</p>
<p>Any concerns with supplier responses throughout data collection were brought to the attention of a member of, or the entire, Tesla Motors Conflict Minerals Steering Committee for further review and action. Suppliers who did not respond were brought to the attention of a Steering Committee member for escalation.</p>
<p>In addition, we continued to engage with other manufacturing companies in Silicon Valley to discuss conflict minerals activities across multiple industries. This Silicon Valley Conflict Minerals Forum has been instrumental in developing an aligned strategy and approach to the conflict minerals due diligence challenge. Tesla regularly participates, hosts gatherings, and encourages participation.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Design and implement a strategy to respond to identified risks</h2>
<p>We performed risk-based assessments on all Tier 1 and potential Tier 1 suppliers as part of our sourcing process and through IMDS we identified which direct suppliers were highly likely to supply products that contain 3TG. Based on this supplier list, we conducted a supply chain survey using the CMRT, requesting Tier 1 suppliers to identify smelters and refiners and country of origin of the conflict minerals. Using the CMRT, we received reports back on Tier 1 supplier progress and collected the determined list of smelters used in the supply chain. We followed up with suppliers that did not respond to the original request for information.</p>
<p>We performed documentation review of the smelters and refiners identified by the Tier 1 suppliers using the CMRT and made further inquiries to suppliers if we needed more clarification. We developed an in-house template to track the progress and response rate to determine next steps and escalation as necessary.</p>
<h2>Step 4: Carry out independent third-party audit of supply chain due diligence at identified points in the supply chain</h2>
<p>We support the CFSI’s outreach efforts and Conflict-Free Smelter Program’s (“CFSP”) smelter audits through our membership. We reserve the right to ask any high risk Tier 1 supplier to audit their supply chain conflict minerals due diligence using a 3rd party independent auditor.</p>
<p>As outlined in the OECD Guidance, the internationally recognized standard on which our company’s system is based, we support an industry initiative that audits smelters’ and refiners’ due diligence activities. That industry initiative is the EICC and GeSI’s Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative. The data on which we relied for certain statements in this declaration was obtained through our membership in the CFSI, using the Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry report for member TSLA.</p>
<h2>Step 5: Report on supply chain due diligence</h2>
<p>We report on our due diligence efforts as required by law.</p>
<h2>Steps Tesla Plans to Take to Mitigate the Risk that Necessary Conflict Minerals Benefit Armed Groups, Including Any Steps to Improve Tesla’s Due Diligence – 2017 focus</h2>
<p>In 2017, we plan to continue our inquiry method and utilize the CFSI’s CMRT to collect and report on due diligence activities with our supply base. We will perform another review of our suppliers who are determined to be highly likely to source 3TG. We plan to continue participation in our Silicon Valley Conflict Minerals Forum and work together with our industry peers to better understand the developments from our joint due diligence efforts. Supplier education is important to our efforts to collect reliable feedback, and we plan to better provide details on our conflict minerals due diligence efforts to our Tier 1 suppliers through distributing information about the CFSI’s efforts and encouraging participation in the CFSI. With our new membership to the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (“EICC”), we will be able to better implement a strategy to address supplier education for not only conflict minerals but other responsible sourcing issues. As a continuous improvement effort, we plan to monitor our due diligence progress over the year as we receive supplier responses to our inquiries and target 100% response rate. We expect to participate in more CFSI smelter engagement outreach efforts and provide feedback to our own supply chain to improve the quality of the responses from our suppliers.</p>
<h2>Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry of the Necessary Conflict Minerals in Tesla’s Products</h2>
<p>Tesla has not yet been able to fully identify countries of origin of 3TG and the smelters and refiners used to process the necessary conflict minerals in Tesla’s products.</p>
<p>We identified 182 suppliers who supply 3TG in their products and required all of these suppliers to perform and report on their supply chain due diligence through the use of the CMRT. More than half of these identified suppliers in scope were new to our supply chain in 2016. We received 77 supplier responses with 3,525 unique smelters and refiners reported comprehensively. Due to our rapid growth and ramp in vehicle production, the number of smelters also more than doubled from the previous year. Tesla’s increase in product volume made it necessary to work with many new and different suppliers starting in calendar year 2016. As a member of the CFSI, we have become better educated about the requirements to conflict free due diligence from the CFSI’s work through conferences, weekly calls, and updates from different working groups within the CFSI. We recognize the importance of working with industry peers and organizations and believe that a consolidated effort to determine reasonable country of origin is the most efficient method. Through our involvement in the CFSI, we contributed information to help identify the current status of many of our smelters. To help determine reasonable country of origin, we continue to monitor and rely upon the CFSI’s progress in dispositioning smelters and refiners. Additionally, we continuously compare the updated list of facilities that are certified by the CFSI as conflict-free smelters or refiners against our own CMRT results throughout the year.</p>
<p>Our Tier 1 suppliers are highly dependent on the information provided to them by their suppliers. Determining the countries of origin of each and every 3TG mineral continues to be a challenge that will take years to complete. While the CFSI has made substantial progress in identifying and assessing smelters and refiners globally, there is still a lot more that can be done.</p>
<p>At the end of 2016, Tesla acquired SolarCity. This late addition to Tesla’s product line and supply chain scope necessitated an intense effort to understand SolarCity’s responsible sourcing policies and due diligence processes. Tesla has been working with SolarCity very closely to identify suppliers in scope for calendar year 2017. Tesla will incorporate SolarCity 3TG due diligence in our report for calendar year 2017.</p>
<p>Based on the information provided by Tesla’s suppliers as well as the CFSI, Tesla believes that the countries of origin of the 3TG contained in its products include the countries listed below in Annex I as well as scrap and recycled sources. This list of countries as well as the smelter and refiner list (Annex II) is based off of CFSI’s RCOI data from March 3, 2017, and Tesla’s 2016 supplier CMRT submissions.</p>
<h2>Other Responsible Sourcing Efforts and Engagement in 2016</h2>
<p>In addition to global laws and regulations that focus on 3TG due diligence, there is increased scrutiny and interest from non-governmental organizations and investors on other minerals and responsible sourcing issues.</p>
<p>In 2016, Tesla was engaged and proactive on addressing a variety of responsible sourcing risks on numerous occasions. In recognition of the importance of responsible sourcing, Tesla joined EICC in early 2017 as a Supporter Member after vetting multiple global organizations.</p>
<p>Much of Tesla’s due diligence effort in 2016 was concentrated on improving our overall responsible sourcing policy and addressing concerns with certain minerals and regions at risk outside the scope of 3TG. Tesla was proactive in engaging direct suppliers and partners to address these other minerals. Similar to our efforts for 3TG, Tesla sent letters to suppliers and requested immediate feedback on any risks associated with mineral sourcing.</p>
<p>Of particular interest has been the sourcing of raw materials contained in the battery cells used in Tesla’s products since battery cells are a major component of our business. Tesla has built strong partnerships with our direct battery cell suppliers. We work closely together to identify and engage with raw materials suppliers that support cell production, which does not typically include 3TG. We request and receive certificates of origin for raw materials, documentation and descriptions of risk management and mitigation policies at these suppliers, and as necessary visit production sites to observe, review, and discuss these risks and how they are addressed. We also check third party audits and evaluations to ensure our direct battery suppliers are complying with all relevant laws and their own corporate policies against child labor, human rights abuses, and other issues that affect responsible sourcing.</p>
<p>Tesla also reviews the requirements that our direct suppliers have with their sub-suppliers. Most importantly, Tesla visits these sub-suppliers when possible to observe and review their processes and risk mitigation techniques. During these visits we look for potential human rights risks, as well as safety or environmental risks, and discuss mitigation efforts directly with the operators. This engagement by Tesla sometimes extends all the way back to the mining stages, where producers are typically a tier 4 supplier to Tesla.</p>
