protect that information, how long we retain it, with whom we share it, 
and what your privacy options are. By using the Services and/or the 
Search Applications, you consent to our collection and use of your 
information as described in this Privacy Policy.<br> <br> We will

business practices, and our users’ needs, and may make changes to the 
Privacy Policy accordingly. Please check this page periodically for 
updates. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will

        <ul>
        <li><strong><em>Our suppliers, subcontractors and business partners (“service providers”):</em></strong>
 We may share your data with our services providers who process your 
personal information to provide services to us or on our behalf. We have
 contracts with our service providers that prohibit them from sharing 
the information about you that they collect or that we provide to them 
with anyone else, or using it for other purposes.</li>

 We may share your information with our affiliates, which are entities 
under common ownership or control of our ultimate parent company,

        <li><strong><em>Our Search Application partners:</em></strong> 
If you have installed and/or use a Search Application, our Search

functionality and/or website, the version of your Search Application or 
your browser settings, the search results and ads you click on, IP 
address, and the address of the web pages you previously visited.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Fraud prevention:</em></strong> We may disclose 
the personal information we collect about our users when we believe

property of us, our users, or others.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Law enforcement purposes:</em></strong> If 
requested or required by government authorities, such as law enforcement

        <li><strong><em>Advertisers and advertising networks:</em></strong>
 Advertisers and advertising networks place ads (including sponsored 
links in search results) on our site and in our mobile applications. 
These companies may collect information, such as your computer’s IP 
address, browser information, mobile device ID, and search queries, as 
you use our Website and Services. They also may use cookies and other 
technologies to collect this information when you visit our site as 
described below.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
        <li>4. <strong> Cookies and Online Advertising:</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Cookies.</strong> We use cookies, pixel tags, web 
beacons and other such similar technologies to collect and store the 
information we automatically collect about your computer, device and 
Service usage. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your 
computer and a pixel tag (also called a web beacon or clear GIF) is a 
tiny graphic with a unique identifier, embedded invisibly on a webpage 
(or an online ad or email). We use the term “cookies” in this policy to 
refer to cookies and all such similar technologies.</p>
        <p>There are two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party 
cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, and 
(2) third party cookies, which are served by a third party on our 
behalf. Cookies have a lot of jobs. For example, our cookies enable us 
to recognize you (e.g. as a registered user) when you visit our website 
and to store your preferences and settings. We use third party cookies 
for functionality, performance / analytics, advertising and social media
 purposes. Cookies from advertising companies, for example, help to 
ensure that the advertisements you see online are more relevant to you 
and your interests. To understand more about cookies and pixel tags,

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>How To Control Or Delete Cookies</strong>:</p>
        <p>Most browsers allow you to change your cookie settings. Users
 can usually set their browsers to block all third-party cookies (which 
are those set by third-party companies collecting information on 
websites operated by other companies), block all cookies (including 
first-party cookies such as the ones IAC Publishing uses to collect 
search activity information about its users), or block specific cookies.
 These settings will typically be found in the “options” or 
“preferences” menu of your browser. In order to understand these 
settings, the following links may be helpful, otherwise you should use 
the “Help”option in your browser for more details.</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Please note that if you choose to block cookies, this may 
interfere with certain functionality on our website. Also, if you have 
disabled one or more cookies, we may still use information collected 
from cookies prior to your disabled preference being set; however, we 
will stop using the disabled cookie to collect any further information.</p>
        <p>Third parties whose products or services are accessible or 
advertised through the Services, including social networking services, 
may also use cookies or similar tools, and we advise you to check their 
privacy policies for information about their cookies and other 
practices. We do not control the practices of such partners and their 
privacy policies govern their interactions with you. We encourage you to
 read their privacy policies.</p>
        <p><strong>Online Behavioral Advertising and Mobile.</strong> 
Advertisers and advertising networks place ads (including sponsored 
links in search results) on our website and in our mobile applications. 
These companies, as well as data analytics companies who service them, 
may use cookies, pixel tags, mobile device IDs and other similar 
technologies to collect data about you when you visit our site. They use
 the data to enable them to track your activity across various sites 
where they display ads and record your activities, so they can show ads 
that they consider relevant to you. You may opt-out of receiving 
targeted online advertising from advertising networks that is delivered 
on reference.com and other websites by visiting the following websites:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Network Advertising Initiative (<a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/">www.networkadvertising.org/</a>)</li>
        <li>Digital Advertising Alliance (<a href="https://www.aboutads.info/consumers">www.aboutads.info/consumers</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please bear in mind that there are many more companies listed on these sites than those that drop cookies on our website.</p>
        <p>If you are using an IAC Publishing mobile application, we use
 your unique mobile device ID number to recognize you when you use the 
application and to store your preferences and settings. Advertising 
companies may also use and store your mobile device ID to show ads that 
they consider relevant to you in various mobile services that you use.</p>
        <p>If you are using an iOS device and you do not want to receive
 tailored in-application ads that relate to your interests, you may 
opt-out by accessing the following link on your device: <a href="https://oo.apple.com/">oo.apple.com</a>.
 If you are using an iOS6 device, you also may limit the delivery of 
tailored ads by: Open Settings and tap “General” then tap “About”; 
Scroll to the bottom of About and tap “Advertising”; Flip “Limit Ad 
Tracking” to ON. If you are using an Android device and you do not wish 
to receive tailored in-application ads, you can visit Google’s <a href="https://www.google.com/ads/preferences/">Ads Preferences</a>
 page from a browser on your device and make your choices there. We do 
not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control 
receiving tailored in-application ads; thus, you should contact the 
platform provider if the above options are no longer available.</p>
        <p><strong>Mobile Device Location Information.</strong> When you
 use one of our location-enabled services (for example, when you access 
Services from a mobile device), we may need to collect and process 
information about your actual GPS location (including the latitude, 
longitude or altitude of your mobile device) and the time the location 
information was recorded. Some of these services require your personal 
data for the feature to work and we may associate location data with 
your device ID and other information we hold about you. We keep this 
data for no longer than is reasonably necessary for providing our 
services. If you wish to use the particular feature, you will be asked 
to consent to your data being used for this purpose. You can withdraw 
your consent at any time by disabling the relevant feature. If you do 
not want your location information collected when you use the Services 
from a mobile device, please follow these instructions:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>If you are using an Apple device, click on “General,” then 
“Reset,” then “Reset Location and Privacy.” This will turn off location 
functionality for all of your apps so that the next time you download or
 use an app, you will be asked again to provide your consent for us and 
others to access your location information.</li>
        <li>If you are using an Android device, visit device settings, 
click “Location,” and then click the boxes for the particular 
applications for which you would like to disable location services.</li>
        <li>If your device changes the above methods of disabling the 
collection of mobile device location, please contact your device 
manufacturer or platform provider to determine how to disable the 
collection of this information.</li>

        <p><strong>Do Not Track.</strong> Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a 
privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a 
way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want 
certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and 
across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you 
with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website 
for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network 
Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out 
links above. However, we do not recognize or respond to 
browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently 
still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to 
comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
        <li>6. <strong> How do we keep the information we collect secure? </strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>We take the security of your personal information seriously 
and use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect 
your personal information against unauthorized or unlawful processing 
and against accidental loss, destruction or damage. We also limit access
 to personal information about you to employees who reasonably need 
access to it to provide products or services to you, or in order to do 
their jobs. However, because no security system can be 100% effective, 
we cannot completely guarantee the security of any information we may 
have collected from or about you.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
        <li>7. <strong> How long do we keep the information we collect?</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>We retain the information we collect about and from you for 
as long as necessary to fulfill a business purpose or comply with a 
legal request. We may also choose to anonymize certain of the 
information you provide to us so that it can no longer be attributed to 
you if we would like to retain it for longer periods of time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
        <li>8. <strong> Children under 13</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Services are not intended for users under the age of 13. 
We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under
 13. If we become aware that a person submitting information is under 
13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible. You 
hereby represent that you are at least 13.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
        <li>9.<strong> Consent to Transfer of Information </strong></li>

        <p>If you are visiting the Services from outside the United

the U.S. By using the Services, you consent to our collection and use of
 your data as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <li>10. <strong> Your California Privacy Rights.</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Under the California Civil Code, California residents have 
the right to request a list of all third parties to which a company 
conducting business in California has disclosed Personal Information 
during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, 
the law provides that, if a company has a Privacy Policy that gives 
either an opt-out (which we may sometimes refer to as "unsubscribe") or 
opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties 
(such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, 
the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise 
your disclosure choice options. If you are a California resident and 
request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure 
choices you must send a request to the following address with a 
preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or 
postal mail). Send an email to us at <a href="mailto:privacy@iacpublishing.com">privacy@iacpublishing.com</a>,
 or you may contact us via regular mail at: IAC Publishing, LLC, 555 
12th Street, Suite 400, Oakland, CA 94607, Attn: Your California Privacy
 Rights c/o Privacy Officer. All requests sent via regular mail must be 
labeled "Your California Privacy Rights" on the envelope or post card 
and clearly stated on the actual request. For all requests, please 
include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code (your 
street address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your 
request via email. Please include your zip code for our own 
recordkeeping).</p>
