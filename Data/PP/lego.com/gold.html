<h2>The LEGO Group Privacy Policy</h2>
<div>Last Modified: November 1st, 2014</div>
<p>The LEGO Group (”LEGO”, ”we”, ”us”, ”our”) considers children and children’s play to be the cornerstone of everything we do. We take this responsibility seriously and always set ambitions high, as only the best is good enough for the builders of tomorrow.  This privacy policy covers the collection, use and disclosure of information by the LEGO Group with LEGO System A/S as the main datacontroller. The LEGO Group is defined as http://aboutus.lego.com/lego-group. </p>
<p>Our privacy policy is designed to provide transparency into our privacy practices and principles in a format that users can navigate, read and understand. We are dedicated to treating your personal information with care, trust and respect.</p>
<p>For that reason the LEGO Group has applied for a Binding Corporate Rules approval from the European data authorities across the European Union and introducing the European data privacy rights protection as a global standard taking into account national legislation outside the European Union. The Binding Corporate Rules encompasses high standards on collection, use, disclosure and generally of your information. You can read more about Binding Corporate Rules here http://lego.com/go/75.</p>
<p>In addition, the LEGO Group has joined a digital child safety program on protecting children online where the LEGO Group is audited regularly. You can read more about this in our Children´s privacy section.</p>
<p>We hope we have earned your trust and hope you will have a playful experience with the LEGO Group.</p>
<p>LEGO has received TRUSTe’s Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and our practices have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe program viewable on the validation page available by clicking on the TRUSTe seal. The TRUSTe certification covers information collected on validated LEGO channels, apps and sites. If you have questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at privacy.officer@lego.com. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact TRUSTe at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.</p>

<p>It is necessary to fulfil an agreement with you,</p>
<p>We legally are obliged to do so, or</p>
<p>We have objective reasons and the processing does not harm you.</p>
<p>We will however always collect your consent as a parent or legal guardian if your child under 13 years is providing personal information online.</p>
<p>We will always inform you of the processing and the purpose of the processing, unless, and only in special cases, we have a legitimate basis not to do so.</p>

We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregate basis.</p>
<p>For more information regarding cookies, please see our Cookie Policy.</p>
<h2>8. Children’s privacy</h2>
<p>We recognize the need to provide further privacy protections with respect to personal information we may process from children on our sites, channels and applications. Some of the features on our sites, channels and applications are age-gated so that they are not available for use by children, and we do not knowingly collect, use, or process personal information from children in connection with those features. When we intend to process personal information from children, we take additional steps to protect children’s privacy, including:</p>
<p>• Notifying parents about our information practices with regard to children, including explaining the types of personal information we may collect, use and process from children, the use we make of that personal information, and whether and with whom we may share that information</p>
<p>• In accordance with applicable law, obtaining consent from parents for the collection, use and processing of personal information from their children, or for sending information about our products and services directly to their children</p>
<p>• Limiting our collection, use and processing of personal information from children to no more than is reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity</p>
<p>• Giving parents access or the ability to request access to personal information we have collected, used or processed from their children and the ability to request that the personal information be changed or deleted</p>
<p>For children in the age group of 13 to 18 years we follow applicable laws.</p>
<p>A. The Information we collect from children, how we use it, and how and when we communicate with parents</p>
<p>The LEGO Group offers to its users a range of sites, channels and applications, some of which are primarily targeted at families with users of all ages and others which are targeted at children. Our sites, channels and applications offer a variety of activities, including activities that may include collection of information from children. Below we summarize potential instances of collection and outline how and when we will provide parental notice and/or seek parental consent. In any instance that we collect personal information from a child, we will retain that information only so long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the activity request or allow the child to continue to participate in the activity, and ensure the security of our users and our services, or as required by law. In the event we discover we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA’s requirements, we will either delete the information or immediately seek the parent’s consent for that collection.</p>
<h2>Registration</h2>
<p>Children can, in many cases, register with our sites and applications to view content, play games, participate in contests, and engage in special features, among other things. During the registration process, we may ask the child to provide certain information for notification and security purposes, including a parent or guardian’s email address, the child’s first name and gender, the child’s member or account username, and password. We may also ask for birth dates from children to validate their ages. We strongly advise children never to provide any personal information in their usernames.</p>
<p>Please note that children can choose whether to share their information with us, but certain features cannot function without it. As a result, children may not be able to access certain features if required information has not been provided. We will not require a child to provide more information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in an online activity.</p>
<p>About the collection of parent email address: Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, on any child-targeted site or application, or in any instance where we ask for age and determine the user is age 12 or under, we will ask for a parent or guardian email address before we collect any personal information from the child. If you believe your child is participating in an activity that collects personal information and you or another parent/guardian have NOT received an email providing notice or seeking your consent, please feel free to contact us at Data Privacy Officer privacy.officer@lego.com. We will not use parent emails provided for parental consent purposes for marketing directed towards the parent, unless the parent has expressly opted in to email marketing or has separately participated in an activity that allows for such email contact.</p>
<h2>Content generated by a child</h2>
<p>Certain activities on our sites, channels and applications allow children to create or handle content and save it with the LEGO Group. Some of these activities do not require children to provide any personal information and therefore may not result in notice to the parent or require parental consent. If an activity potentially allows a child to insert personal information in their created content, we will either pre-screen the submission to delete any personal information, or we will seek a parental consent by email for the collection. Examples of created content that may include personal information are:</p>
<p>- stories or other open-text fields,</p>
<p>- drawings that allow text or free-hand entry of information,</p>
<p>- pictures of your child,</p>
<p>- audio or movie files representing your child, and</p>
<p>- other persistent identifiers that can be used to clearly identify your child.</p>
<p>If, in addition to collecting content that includes personal information, the LEGO Group also plans to post the content publicly or share it with a third party for the third party’s own use, we will obtain a higher level of parental consent(verifiable parental consent</p>
<h2>Parental consent mechanisms:</h2>
<h2>Email consent (low level consent):</h2>
<p>In the event the LEGO Group wishes to collect personal information from a child, COPPA requires that we first seek a parent or guardian’s consent by email. In the email we will explain what information we are collecting, how we plan to use it, how the parent can provide consent, and how the parent can revoke consent. If we do not receive parental consent within a reasonable time, we will delete the parent contact information and any other personal information collected from the child collected for the purpose of contacting you.</p>
<h2>Verifiable consent (high level consent):</h2>
<p>In the event the LEGO Group collects personal information from a child that will be posted publicly or disclosed to a third party, we will seek a higher level of consent than email consent. Such “high-level” methods of consent include but are not limited to asking for a credit card or other payment method for verification (with a nominal charge involved), speaking to a trained customer service representative by telephone or video chat, or requiring a signed consent form by mail, email attachment, or fax. After providing high-level consent, a parent may have the opportunity to use a pin or password in future communications as a way to confirm the parent’s identity.</p>
<h2>Contests and sweepstakes</h2>
<p>For contests and sweepstakes, we typically require only the personal information necessary for a child to participate, such as first name (to distinguish among family members) and parent email address (to notify the parent where required by law). We only contact the parent for more personalized information for prize-fulfilment purposes when the child wins the contest or sweepstake.</p>
<p>Of course, some contests and sweepstakes ask the child to submit their own created content along with the child’s entry. In those instances, we may require parental consent prior to submission. Please see content generated by a child above for more information on our collection, notice, and consent policies. Parent’s will be sent a notice along with instructions on how they may provide their consent for their child to particiapate in such activities via email (sent to the email address on file for the parent).  We will not allow your child to participate in such activities until we have received your consent for them to do so.</p>
<h2>Email contact with a child</h2>
<p>On occasion, in order to respond to a question or request from a child, the LEGO Group may need to ask for the child’s online contact information, such as an email address. The LEGO Group will delete this information immediately after responding to the question or request.</p>
<p>In connection with certain activities or services, we may collect a child’s online contact information, such as an email address which is collected from the parent, in order to communicate with the child more than once. In such instances we will retain the child’s online contact information to honour the request and for no other purpose such as marketing. One example would be a newsletter that provides occasional updates about a site, game/activity, television show, personality/character, or feature movie. Whenever we collect a child’s online contact information for ongoing communications, we will simultaneously require a parent email address in order to notify the parent about the collection and use of the child’s information, as well as to provide the parent an opportunity to prevent further contact with the child. On some occasions a child may be engaged in more than one ongoing communication, and a parent may be required to “opt-out” of each communication individually. Parent’s may opt their child out from receving these types of communications by following the unsubscribe instructions located within each communication or by emailing us at http://service.lego.com/contactus.</p>
<h2>Push notifications:</h2>
<p>Push notifications are notifications on mobile and other devices that are typically associated with downloaded applications, and which can communicate to the device holder even when the application is not in use. We will require a child to provide a parent email address before the child can receive push notifications from our child-directed applications that collect a device identifier. We will then provide the parent with notice of our contact with the child and will provide the parent the opportunity to prevent further notifications. Finally, we will not associate the device identifier with other personal information without contacting the parent to get consent.  If you no longer wish to allow your child to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level.</p>
<h2>Geolocation:</h2>
<p>If a child-directed site, channel or application collects information on children´s geographical location (geolocation information) on street name, address or coordinates we will first seek parental consent via email. This also means that we will in some instances collect data on children´s geolocation information where parental consent is not required i.e. information not linked to the specific child in regards to city, country and region.  In order to request that we no longer collect such information you may turn this off at the device level in the settings or by contacting us at http://service.lego.com/contactus.</p>
<h2>Persistent identifiers:</h2>
<p>When children interact with us, certain information may automatically be collected, both to make our sites and applications more interesting and useful to children and for various purposes related to our business. Examples include the type of computer operating system, the child’s IP address or mobile device identifier, the web browser, the frequency with which the child visits various parts of our sites or applications, and information regarding the online or mobile service provider. This information is collected using technologies such as cookies, flash cookies, web beacons, and other unique identifiers (which we define under the “Cookie Policy” section of our general Privacy Policy). This information may be collected by the LEGO Group or by a third party processing on behalf of the LEGO Group. This data is principally used for internal purposes only, in order to:</p>
<p>• provide children with access to features and activities on our sites and applications</p>
<p>• customize content and improve our sites and applications</p>
<p>• conduct research and analysis to address the performance of our sites and applications</p>
<p>• generate anonymous reporting for use by the LEGO Group</p>
<p>In the event we collect (or allow others to collect) such information from children on our sites and applications for other purposes, we will notify parents and obtain consent prior to such collection</p>
<p>The list of third-party operators who collect persistent identifiers on our sites and applications may be found here – Cookie Policy http://www.lego.com/legal/cookieinfo</p>
<p>B. When information collected from children is made available to others</p>
<p>In addition to those rare instances where a child’s personal information is posted publicly (after receiving high-level parental consent), we also may share or disclose personal information collected from children in a limited number of instances, including the following:</p>
<p>• We may share information with our service providers like software solutions, online security, and customer service; however, these companies are prohibited from using your personal information for purposes other than those clearly defined by us or required by law and we have written contracts in place to ensure this.</p>
<p>• We may disclose personal information if permitted or required by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose personal information collected from children (i) in response to a law enforcement or public agency’s (including schools or children services) request; (ii) if we believe disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our sites or applications; (iii) to protect the security or integrity of our sites, applications, and other technology, as well as the technology of our service providers; or (iv) enable us to take precautions against liability.</p>
<p>• Parents have the right to consent to the collection, use and processing of their childs personal information without also having to consent to the disclosure of that information to third parties as we do not share information with third parties other than as disclosed above.</p>
<p>C. Parental choices and controls</p>
<p>At any time, parents can refuse to permit us to use and collect further personal information from their children in association with a particular account, and can request that we delete from our records the personal information we have collected in connection with that account. Please keep in mind that a request to delete records may lead to a termination of an account, membership, or other service.</p>
<p>Where a child has registered for a LEGO ID account, we use two methods to allow parents to access, change, or delete the personally identifiable information that we have collected from their children:</p>
<p>1.Parents can request access to and delete their child’s personal information by logging on to the child’s </p> 
<p>account through the https://account.lego.com site located here. Parents will need their child’s username and password. The</p>
<p>https://account.lego.com site home page explains how to recover a password if the child cannot recall it.</p>
<p>2.Parents can contact Consumer Services to request access to, change, or delete their child’s personal</p>
<p>information by clicking here http://service.lego.com/contactus.</p>
