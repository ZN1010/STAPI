 collect the following types of personal information in order to provide
 you with the use of PayPal Services, and to help us personalize and 
improve your experience.</p> <p><strong>Information</strong><strong> we collect </strong><strong>automatically:</strong>&nbsp;When

you access, computer IP address, device ID or unique identifier, device 
type, geo-location information, computer and connection information,

 of cookies and web beacons (visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paypalobjects.com/webstatic/ua/pdf/cookie/PayPal_Cookie_Policy.pdf"><strong>How we use Cookies and Similar Technologies</strong></a>&nbsp;for more information).</p> <p><strong>Information</strong><strong> you </strong><strong>provide to us:</strong>&nbsp;We
 may collect and store any information you provide us when you use 
PayPal Services, including when you add information on a web form, add 
or update your account information, participate in community 
discussions, chats, or dispute resolutions, or when you otherwise 
correspond with us regarding PayPal Services.</p> <p>When you use PayPal
 Services, we also collect information about your transactions and your 
activities. In addition, if you open a PayPal account or use PayPal 
Services, we may collect the following types of information:</p> <ul> <li>Contact information, such as your name, address, phone, email and other similar information.</li> <li>Financial
 information, such as the full bank account numbers and/or credit card 
numbers that you link to your PayPal account or give us when you use 
PayPal Services.</li> <li>Detailed personal information such as your date of birth or national ID number.</li> </ul> <p>We
 may also collect information from or about you from other sources, such
 as through your contact with us, including our customer support team, 
your results when you respond to a survey, your interactions with 
members of the PayPal corporate family or other companies (subject to 
their privacy policies and applicable law), and from other accounts we 
have reason to believe you control (whether in part or in whole). 
Additionally, for quality and training purposes or for its own 
protection, PayPal may monitor or record its telephone conversations 
with you or anyone acting on your behalf. By communicating with PayPal, 
you acknowledge that your communication may be overheard, monitored, or 
recorded without further notice or warning.</p> <p><strong>Information from other sources:</strong>&nbsp;We
 may also obtain information about you from third parties such as credit
 bureaus and identity verification services.&nbsp;</p> <p>You may choose
 to provide us with access to certain personal information stored by 
third parties such as social media sites (e.g., Facebook and Twitter). 
The information we may receive varies by site and is controlled by that 
site. By associating an account managed by a third party with your 
PayPal account and authorizing PayPal to have access to this 
information, you agree that PayPal may collect, store and use this 
information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p> <p><strong>Authentication and Fraud Detection:</strong>&nbsp;In
 order to help protect you from fraud and misuse of your personal 
information, we may collect information about you and your interactions 
with PayPal Services. We may also evaluate your computer, mobile phone 
or other access device to identify any malicious software or activity.</p> <p><strong>Using Your Mobile Device:</strong>&nbsp;We
 may offer you the ability to connect with PayPal Services using a 
mobile device, either through a mobile application or via a mobile 
optimized website. The provisions of this Privacy Policy apply to all 
such mobile access and use of mobile devices.</p> <p>When you download 
or use our mobile applications, or access one of our mobile optimized 
sites, we may receive information about your location and your mobile 
device, including a unique identifier for your device. We may use this 
information to provide you with location-based services, such as 
advertising, search results, and other personalized content. Most mobile
 devices allow you to control or disable location services in the 
device's setting's menu. If you have questions about how to disable your
 device's location services, we recommend you contact your mobile 
service carrier or the manufacture of your particular device.</p> <p align="right"><a href="#top"><strong>Back to top</strong></a></p> <p><a id="3" name="3"></a></p> <h3>How We Use the Personal Information We Collect</h3> <p>Our

 may contact you via electronic means or postal mail to notify you 
regarding your account, to troubleshoot problems with your account, to 
resolve a dispute, to collect fees or monies owed, to poll your opinions
 through surveys or questionnaires, or as otherwise necessary to service
 your account. Additionally, we may contact you to offer coupons, 
discounts and promotions, and inform you about PayPal Services and the 
services of our corporate family. Finally, we may contact you as 
necessary to enforce our policies, applicable law, or any agreement we 
may have with you. When contacting you via phone, to reach you as 
efficiently as possible we may use, and you consent to receive, 
autodialed or prerecorded calls and text messages. Where applicable and 
permitted by law, you may decline to receive certain communications.</p> <p align="right"><a href="#top"><strong>Back to top</strong></a></p> <h3><a id="4" name="4"></a></h3> <h3>Marketing</h3> <p>We
 do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for 
their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may combine 
your information with information we collect from other companies and 
use it to improve and personalize PayPal Services, content, and 
advertising. If you do not wish to receive marketing communications from
 us or participate in our ad-customization programs, simply indicate 
your preference by logging into your account and going to the 
Notifications section&nbsp; and updating your preferences, or by 
following the directions that may be provided within the communication

you no longer wish to receive notifications via our application, you can
 adjust your preferences by visiting the settings page of the 
application.</p> <p align="right"><a href="#top"><strong>Back to top</strong></a></p> <h3><a id="5" name="5"></a></h3> <h3>How We Use Cookies and Similar Technologies</h3> <p>When
 you access our website or use PayPal Services, we (including companies 
we work with) may place small data files on your computer or other 
device. These data files may be cookies, pixel tags, "Flash cookies," or
 other local storage provided by your browser or associated applications
 (collectively "Cookies"). We use these technologies to recognize you as
 a customer; customize PayPal Services, content, and advertising; 
measure promotional effectiveness; help ensure that your account 
security is not compromised; mitigate risk and prevent fraud; and to 
promote trust and safety across our sites and PayPal Services.</p> <p>You
 are free to decline our Cookies if your browser or browser add-on 
permits, unless our Cookies are required to prevent fraud or ensure the 
security of websites we control. However, declining our Cookies may 
interfere with your use of our website and PayPal Services.</p> <p>For more detailed information on our use of these technologies, please see our policy on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paypalobjects.com/webstatic/ua/pdf/cookie/PayPal_Cookie_Policy.pdf"><strong>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies</strong></a>.</p> <p align="right"><a href="#top"><strong>Back to top</strong></a></p> <h3><a id="6" name="6"></a></h3> <h3>How We Protect and Store Personal Information</h3> <p>Throughout
 this Privacy Policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe
 information that can be associated with a specific person and can be 
used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to
 include information that has been made anonymous so that it does not 
identify a specific user.</p> <p>We store and process your personal 
information on our computers in North America, Asia, Europe and 
elsewhere in the world where our facilities are located. We protect your
 information using physical, technical, and administrative security 
measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, 
disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls 
and data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and 
information access authorization controls.</p> <p align="right"><a href="#top"><strong>Back to top</strong></a></p> <h3><a id="7" name="7"></a></h3> <h3>How We Share Personal Information with Other PayPal Users</h3> <p>When
 transacting with others, we may provide those parties with information 
about you necessary to complete the transaction, such as your name, 
account ID, contact details, shipping and billing address, or other 
information needed to promote the reliability and security of the 
transaction. If a transaction is held, fails, or is later invalidated, 
we may also provide details of the unsuccessful transaction. To 
facilitate dispute resolution, we may provide a buyer with the seller’s 
address so that goods can be returned to the seller.&nbsp; The receiving
 party is not allowed to use this information for unrelated purposes, 
such as to directly market to you, unless you have agreed to it. 
Contacting users with unwanted or threatening messages is against our 
policies and constitutes a violation of our User Agreement.</p> <p>If 
someone is sending you money and enters your email address or phone 
number, we will provide them your registered name so they can verify 
they are sending the money to the correct account.</p> <p>We work with 
third parties, including merchants, to enable them to accept or send 
payments from or to you using PayPal. In doing so, a third party may 
share information about you with us, such as your email address or 
mobile phone number, to inform you that a payment has been sent to you 
or when you attempt to pay a merchant or third party. We use this 
information to confirm that you are a PayPal customer and that PayPal as
 a form of payment can be enabled, or to send you notification of 
payment status. Also, if you request that we validate your status as a 
PayPal customer with a third party, we will do so.</p> <p>If you link 
your loyalty or gift card of a PayPal merchant to your account, we may 
share your card number with that merchant when you pay using PayPal.</p> <p>Please
 note that merchants, sellers, and users you buy from or contract with 
have their own privacy policies, and although PayPal’s User Agreement 
does not allow the other transacting party to use this information for 
anything other than providing PayPal Services, PayPal is not responsible
 for their actions, including their information protection practices.</p> <p>Regardless,
 we will not disclose your credit card number or bank account number to 
anyone you have paid or who has paid you using PayPal, or with the third
 parties that offer or use PayPal Services, except with your express 
permission or if we are required to do so to comply with credit card 
rules, a subpoena, or other legal process.</p> <p align="right"><a href="#top"><strong>Back to top</strong></a></p> <h3><a id="8" name="8"></a></h3> <h3>How We Share Personal Information with Other Third Parties</h3> <p>We may share your personal information with:</p> <ul> <li>Members
 of the PayPal corporate family, such as PayPal Credit, Venmo or 
Braintree, to provide joint content, products, and services (such as 
registration, transactions and customer support), to help detect and 
prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to 
guide decisions about their products, services, and communications. 
Members of our corporate family will use this information to send you 
marketing communications only if you have requested their services.</li> <li>Financial
 institutions that we partner with to jointly create and offer a product
 (including but not limited to, the PayPal&nbsp;Extras credit card where
 we share information with GE&nbsp;Capital to determine whether you 
should receive pre-approved offers for the PayPal&nbsp;Extras credit 
card). These financial institutions may only use this information to 
market PayPal-related products, unless you have given consent for other 
uses.</li> <li>Credit bureaus and collection agencies to report account information, as permitted by law.</li> <li>Banking
 partners as required by credit card association rules for inclusion on 
their list of terminated merchants (in the event that you meet their 
criteria which includes having PayPal close your PayPal Account due to 
your breach of PayPal’s User Agreement).</li> <li>Companies that we plan
 to merge with or are acquired by. (Should such a combination occur, we 
will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy 
with respect to your personal information. If your personal information 
could be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice.)</li> <li>Law
 enforcement,&nbsp; regulators, government officials, or other third 
parties (in Singapore or elsewhere) in relation to a subpoena, court 
order, or other legal process or requirement&nbsp; under Singapore law 
or regulation, or the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions that 
are applicable to PayPal or one of its Affiliates; when we need to do so
 to comply with such law or credit card rules; or when we believe, in 
our sole discretion, that the disclosure of personal information is 
necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss; to report 
suspected illegal activity or investigate violations of our User 
Agreement&nbsp;</li> <li>Other unaffiliated third parties, for the following purposes: <ul style="list-style-type: disc;"> <li><u>Fraud Prevention and Risk Management</u>:
 to help prevent fraud or assess and manage risk.&nbsp; For example, if 
you use the PayPal Services to buy or sell goods using eBay Inc. or its 
affiliates (“eBay”), we may share account information in order to help 
protect your account from fraudulent activity, alert you if we detect 
such fraudulent activity on your accounts, or evaluate credit risk.<br> <br>
 As part of our fraud prevention and risk management efforts, we also 
may share necessary account information with eBay in cases where PayPal 
has placed a hold or other restriction on your Account based on 
disputes, claims, chargebacks or other scenarios regarding the sale or 
purchase of goods. Also, as part of our fraud prevention and risk 
management efforts, we may share account information with eBay to enable
 them to operate their programs for evaluating buyers or sellers.</li> <li><u>Customer Service</u>:
 for customer service purposes, including to help service your accounts 
or resolve disputes (e.g., billing or transactional).&nbsp;</li> <li><u>Shipping</u>: in connection with shipping and related services for purchases made using PayPal.&nbsp;</li> <li><u>Legal Compliance</u>: to help them comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing verification requirements.</li> <li><u>Service Providers</u>:
 to enable service providers under contract with us to support our 
business operations, such as fraud prevention, bill collection, 
marketing, customer service and technology services. Our contracts 
dictate that these service providers only use your information in 
connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own 
benefit.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so.</li> </ul> <p>Please
 note that these third parties may be in other countries where the laws 
on processing personal information may be less stringent than in your 
country.</p> <p>If you open a PayPal account directly on a third party 
website or via a third party application, any information that you enter
 on that website or application (and not directly on a PayPal website) 
will be shared with the owner of the third party website or application.
 These sites are governed by their own privacy policies and you are 
encouraged to review their privacy policies before providing them with 
personal information. PayPal is not responsible for the content or 
information practices of such third parties.</p> <p align="right"><a href="#top"><strong>Back to top</strong></a></p> <h3><a id="9" name="9"></a></h3> <h3>Cross Border Transfers of Personal Information</h3> <p>PayPal

 In with PayPal is a tool we’ve developed to improve your Internet 
experience. Log In with PayPal allows you to streamline and simplify the
 account creation and login process when using third-party websites, and
 it allows these websites to enhance your experience on their sites. 
Instead of creating multiple usernames and passwords for each website 
you visit, Log In with PayPal allows you to sign in to a participating 
website using your existing PayPal login information. When you use Log 
In with PayPal, you agree that PayPal can share the information listed 
on the Log In with PayPal consent screen or in your Log In with PayPal 
account settings with the participating website. Information you allow 
PayPal to share with these third-party websites is subject to each 
third-party’s terms of service and privacy agreement, so you are 
encouraged to review their policies.</p> <p align="right"><a href="#top"><strong>Back to top</strong></a></p> <p><a id="11" name="11"></a></p> <h3>How You Can Access or Change Your Personal Information</h3> <p>You
 can review and edit your personal information at any time by logging in
 to your account and reviewing your account settings and profile. You 
can also close your account through the PayPal website. If you close 
your PayPal account, we will mark your account in our database as 
"Closed," but may retain personal information from your account for a 
certain period of time to collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, 
troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, prevent fraud, 
enforce our User Agreement, or take other actions as required or 
permitted by law.</p> <p>If you would like to limit the processing of

otherwise. Should you fail to provide us with your personal data, we may
