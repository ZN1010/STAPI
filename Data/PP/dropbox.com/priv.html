    <h2>Dropbox Terms of Service</h2>
    <p>Posted: December 8, 2016</p>
    <p>Effective: February 10, 2017</p>

    <p>
        Thanks for using Dropbox! These terms of service ("<b>Terms</b>") cover your use and access to our services, client software and websites ("<b>Services</b>"). If you reside outside of the United States of America, Canada and Mexico ("<b>North America</b>")
 your agreement is with Dropbox International Unlimited Company, and if 
you reside in North America your agreement is with Dropbox, Inc. Our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/privacy2017">Privacy Policy</a> explains how we collect and use your information while our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/terms#acceptable_use">Acceptable Use Policy</a> outlines your responsibilities when using our Services. By using our Services, you're agreeing to be bound by these Terms, our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/privacy2017">Privacy Policy</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/terms#acceptable_use">Acceptable Use Policy</a>. If you're using our Services for an organization, you're agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that organization.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Stuff &amp; Your Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        When you use our Services, you provide us with things like your files, content, messages, contacts and so on ("<b>Your Stuff</b>").
 Your Stuff is yours. These Terms don't give us any rights to Your Stuff
 except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        We need your permission to do things like hosting Your Stuff, 
backing it up, and sharing it when you ask us to. Our Services also 
provide you with features like photo thumbnails, document previews, 
commenting, easy sorting, editing, sharing and searching. These and 
other features may require our systems to access, store and scan Your 
Stuff. You give us permission to do those things, and this permission 
extends to our affiliates and trusted third parties we work with.
    </p>

    <h2>Sharing Your Stuff</h2>
    <p>
        Our Services let you share Your Stuff with others, so please think carefully about what you share.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>
        You're responsible for your conduct. Your Stuff and you must comply with our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/terms#acceptable_use">Acceptable Use Policy</a>.
 Content in the Services may be protected by others' intellectual 
property rights. Please don't copy, upload, download or share content 
unless you have the right to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may review your conduct and content for compliance with these Terms and our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/terms#acceptable_use">Acceptable Use Policy</a>. With that said, we have no obligation to do so. We aren't responsible for the content people post and share via the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Help us keep you informed and Your Stuff protected. Safeguard 
your password to the Services, and keep your account information 
current. Don't share your account credentials or give others access to 
your account.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may use our Services only as permitted by applicable law, 
including export control laws and regulations. Finally, our Services are
 not intended for and may not be used by people under the age of 13. By 
using our Services, you are representing to us that you're over 13.
    </p>

    <h2>Software</h2>
    <p>
        Some of our Services allow you to download client software ("<b>Software</b>")
 which may update automatically. So long as you comply with these Terms,
 we give you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license
 to use the Software, solely to access the Services. To the extent any 
component of the Software may be offered under an open source license, 
we'll make that license available to you and the provisions of that 
license may expressly override some of these Terms. Unless the following
 restrictions are prohibited by law, you agree not to reverse engineer 
or decompile the Services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing 
so.
    </p>

    <h2>Beta Services</h2>
    <p>
        We sometimes release products and features that we are still 
testing and evaluating. Those Services have been marked beta, preview, 
early access, or evaluation (or with words or phrases with similar 
meanings) and may not be as reliable as Dropbox's other services, so 
please keep that in mind.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Stuff</h2>
    <p>
        The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other US
 and foreign laws. These Terms don't grant you any right, title or 
interest in the Services, others' content in the Services, Dropbox 
trademarks, logos and other brand features. We welcome feedback, but 
note that we may use comments or suggestions without any obligation to 
you.
    </p>

    <h2>Copyright</h2>
    <p>
        We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you 
do too. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they 
comply with the law, and such notices should be reported using our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/dmca">Copyright Policy</a>.
 We reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be 
infringing and terminate accounts of repeat infringers. Our designated 
agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement on the Services is:
    </p>
    <p>
        Copyright Agent<br>
        Dropbox, Inc.<br>
        333 Brannan Street<br>
        San Francisco, CA 94107<br>
        copyright@dropbox.com
    </p>

    <h2>Paid Accounts</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Billing</em>. You can increase your storage space and add paid features to your account (turning your account into a "<b>Paid Account</b>").
 We'll automatically bill you from the date you convert to a Paid 
Account and on each periodic renewal until cancellation. If you're on an
 annual plan, we'll send you a notice email reminding you that your plan
 is about to renew within a reasonable period of time prior to the 
renewal date. You're responsible for all applicable taxes, and we'll 
charge tax when required to do so. Some countries have mandatory local 
laws regarding your cancellation rights, and this paragraph doesn't 
override these laws.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>No Refunds</em>. You may cancel your <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/158">Dropbox Paid Account</a> at any time. Refunds are only issued if <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/9069">required by law</a>.
 For example, users living in the European Union have the right to 
cancel their Paid Account subscriptions within 14 days of signing up 
for, upgrading to or renewing a Paid Account.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Downgrades</em>. Your Paid Account will remain in effect 
until it's cancelled or terminated under these Terms. If you don't pay 
for your Paid Account on time, we reserve the right to suspend it or 
reduce your storage to free space levels.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Changes</em>. We may change the fees in effect but will give
 you advance notice of these changes via a message to the email address 
associated with your account.
    </p>

    <h2>Dropbox Teams</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Email address</em>. If you sign up for a Dropbox account 
with an email address provisioned by your organization, your 
organization may be able to block your use of Dropbox until you 
transition to an account on a Dropbox team (e.g., Dropbox Business plans
 or Dropbox Education) or you associate your Dropbox account with a 
personal email address.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Using Dropbox Teams</em>. If you join a Dropbox team, you 
must use it in compliance with your organization's terms and policies. 
Please note that Dropbox team accounts are subject to your 
organization's control. Your administrators may be able to access, 
disclose, restrict, or remove information in or from your Dropbox team 
account. They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to a
 Dropbox team account. If you convert an existing Dropbox account into 
part of a Dropbox team, your administrators may prevent you from later 
disassociating your account from the Dropbox team.
    </p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>
        You're free to stop using our Services at any time. We reserve 
the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services with 
notice to you if:
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        (a) you're in breach of these Terms,
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        (b) you're using the Services in a manner that would cause a real risk of harm or loss to us or other users, or
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        (c) you don't have a Paid Account and haven't accessed our Services for 12 consecutive months.
    </p>
    <p>
        We'll provide you with reasonable advance notice via the email 
address associated with your account  to remedy the activity that 
prompted us to contact you and give you the opportunity to export Your 
Stuff from our Services. If after such notice you fail to take the steps
 we ask of you, we'll terminate or suspend your access to the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        We won't provide notice before termination where:
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        (a) you're in material breach of these Terms,
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        (b) doing so would cause us legal liability or compromise our ability to provide the Services to our other users, or
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        (c) we're prohibited from doing so by law.
    </p>
    <h2>Discontinuation of Services</h2>
    <p>
        We may decide to discontinue the Services in response to 
unforeseen circumstances beyond Dropbox's control or to comply with a 
legal requirement. If we do so, we'll give you reasonable prior notice 
so that you can export Your Stuff from our systems. If we discontinue 
Services in this way before the end of any fixed or minimum term you 
have paid us for, we'll refund the portion of the fees you have pre-paid
 but haven't received Services for.
    </p>
    <h2>Services "AS IS"</h2>
    <p>
        We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain 
things that we can't guarantee. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, 
DROPBOX AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO 
WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES. THE SERVICES 
ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. 
Some places don't allow the disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may 
not apply to you.
    </p>
    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
        WE DON'T EXCLUDE OR LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU WHERE IT WOULD BE
 ILLEGAL TO DO SO—THIS INCLUDES ANY LIABILITY FOR DROPBOX'S OR ITS 
AFFILIATES' FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION IN PROVIDING THE 
SERVICES. IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF EXCLUSIONS AREN'T 
ALLOWED, WE'RE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU ONLY FOR LOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A
 REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE AND
 SKILL OR OUR BREACH OF OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU. THIS PARAGRAPH DOESN'T 
AFFECT CONSUMER RIGHTS THAT CAN'T BE WAIVED OR LIMITED BY ANY CONTRACT 
OR AGREEMENT.
    </p>
    <p>
        IN COUNTRIES WHERE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE 
ALLOWED, DROPBOX, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WON'T BE 
LIABLE FOR:
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        i. ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        ii. ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY.
    </p>
    <p>
        THESE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
 OR NOT DROPBOX OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    </p>
    <p>
        IF YOU USE THE SERVICES FOR ANY COMMERCIAL, BUSINESS OR RE-SALE 
PURPOSE, DROPBOX, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WILL HAVE NO
 LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF BUSINESS, BUSINESS 
INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. DROPBOX AND ITS 
AFFILIATES AREN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR 
OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICES.
    </p>
    <p>
        OTHER THAN FOR THE TYPES OF LIABILITY WE CANNOT LIMIT BY LAW (AS
 DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION), WE LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU TO THE 
GREATER OF $20 USD OR 100% OF ANY AMOUNT YOU'VE PAID UNDER YOUR CURRENT 
SERVICE PLAN WITH DROPBOX.
    </p>

    <h2>Resolving Disputes</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Let's Try To Sort Things Out First</em>. We want to address 
your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim
 against Dropbox, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by 
contacting dispute-notice@dropbox.com. We'll try to resolve the dispute 
informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved 
within 15 days of submission, you or Dropbox may bring a formal 
proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Judicial forum for disputes</em>. You and Dropbox agree that
 any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms or 
the Services will be brought in the federal or state courts of San 
Francisco County, California, subject to the mandatory arbitration 
provisions below. Both you and Dropbox consent to venue and personal 
jurisdiction in such courts. If you reside in a country (for example, 
European Union member states) with laws that give consumers the right to
 bring disputes in their local courts, this paragraph doesn't affect 
those requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>IF YOU'RE A U.S. RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        <em>We Both Agree To Arbitrate</em>. You and Dropbox agree to 
resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Services through final
 and binding arbitration by a single arbitrator, except as set forth 
under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below. This includes disputes
 arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this 
"Mandatory Arbitration Provisions" section, including its 
enforceability, revocability, or validity.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        <em>Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate</em>. You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/arbitration_optout">clicking here</a>
 and submitting the opt-out form within 30 days of first registering 
your account. However, if you agreed to a previous version of these 
Terms that allowed you to opt out of arbitration, your previous choice 
to opt out or not opt out remains binding.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        <em>Arbitration Procedures</em>. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adr.org/">American Arbitration Association</a>
 (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration 
Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. 
The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live 
or work, San Francisco (CA), or any other location we agree to.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        <em>Arbitration Fees and Incentives</em>. The AAA rules will 
govern payment of all arbitration fees. Dropbox will pay all arbitration
 fees for individual arbitration for claims less than $75,000. If you 
receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we 
make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the 
award. Dropbox will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in 
arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is 
frivolous.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        <em>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</em>. Either you or 
Dropbox may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San
 Francisco (CA) or any United States county where you live or work. 
Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop 
unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property 
infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent
 rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal 
dispute-resolution process described above. If the agreement to 
arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree to the 
exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in San Francisco 
County, California to resolve your claim.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        <b><em>NO CLASS ACTIONS</em>.</b> You may only resolve disputes 
with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff
 or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. 
Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and
 consolidation with other arbitrations aren't allowed. If this specific 
paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Mandatory 
Arbitration Provisions" section will be deemed void.
    </p>

    <h2>Controlling Law</h2>
    <p>
        These Terms will be governed by California law except for its 
conflicts of laws principles. However, some countries (including those 
in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed 
by the local laws of the consumer's country. This paragraph doesn't 
override those laws.
    </p>

    <h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
    <p>
        These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and 
Dropbox with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede
 and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and
 conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. These Terms
 create no third party beneficiary rights.
    </p>

    <h2>Waiver, Severability &amp; Assignment</h2>
    <p>
        Dropbox's failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its 
right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the 
remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an 
enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as
 possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and 
any such attempt will be void. Dropbox may assign its rights to any of 
its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any 
business associated with the Services.
    </p>

    <h2>Modifications</h2>
    <p>
        We may revise these Terms from time to time to better reflect:
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        (a) changes to the law,
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        (b) new regulatory requirements, or
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        (c) improvements or enhancements made to our Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        If an update affects your use of the Services or your legal 
rights as a user of our Services, we'll notify you prior to the update's
 effective date by sending an email to the email address associated with
 your account or via an in-product notification. These updated terms 
will be effective no less than 30 days from when we notify you.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you don't agree to the updates we make, please cancel your 
account before they become effective. Where applicable, we'll offer you a
 prorated refund based on the amounts you have prepaid for Services and 
your account cancellation date. By continuing to use or access the 
Services after the updates come into effect, you agree to be bound by 
the revised Terms.

    <h2>Dropbox Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>Posted: December 8, 2016</p>
    <p>Effective: February 10, 2017</p>

    <p>
        Thanks for using Dropbox! Here we describe how we collect, use 
and handle your information when you use our websites, software and 
services ("<b>Services</b>").
    </p>
    <h2>What &amp; Why</h2>
    <p>
        We collect and use the following information to provide, improve and protect our Services:
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Account</em>. We collect, and associate with your account, 
information like your name, email address, phone number, payment info, 
physical address, and account activity. Some of our services let you 
access your accounts and your information with other service providers.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Services</em>. Our Services are designed to make it simple 
for you to store Your Stuff, collaborate with others, and work across 
multiple devices. To make that possible, we store, process, and transmit
 Your Stuff—like files, messages, comments, and photos—as well as 
information related to it. This related information can be things like 
your <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/63">profile information</a>
 that makes it easier to collaborate and share Your Stuff with others. 
Our Services provide you with different options for sharing Your Stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may choose to give us access to your contacts to make it 
easy for you to do things like share and collaborate on Your Stuff, send
 messages, and invite others to use the Services. If you do, we'll store
 those contacts on our servers for you to use.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Usage</em>. We collect information related to how you use 
the Services, including actions you take in your account (like sharing, 
editing, viewing, and moving files or folders). This helps us provide 
you with features like the "Events" page and version history.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also collect information from and about the devices you use 
to access the Services. This includes things like IP addresses, the type
 of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming 
to our sites, and identifiers associated with your devices. Your devices
 (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to
 the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Cookies and other technologies</em>. We use technologies like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/terms/cookies">cookies and pixel tags</a>
 to provide, improve, protect and promote our Services. For example, 
cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next
 visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and 
improving them based on that information. You can set your browser to 
not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services.
 If our systems receive a DNT:1 signal from your browser, we'll respond 
to that signal as outlined <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/terms/cookies">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>With whom</h2>
    <p>
        We may share information as discussed below, but we won't sell it to advertisers or other third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Others working for Dropbox</em>. Dropbox uses certain 
trusted third parties (for example, providers of customer support and IT
 services) to help us provide, improve, protect, and promote our 
Services. These third parties will access your information only to 
perform tasks on our behalf in compliance with this Privacy Policy, and 
we'll remain responsible for their handling of your information per our 
instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Other users</em>. Our Services display information like your
 name, profile picture, and email address to other users in places like 
your user profile and sharing notifications. When you register your 
Dropbox account with an email address on a domain owned by your employer
 or organization, we may help collaborators find you and your team by 
making some of your basic information—like your name, team name, profile
 picture, and email address—visible to other users on the same domain. 
This helps us show you teams you can join, and helps other users share 
files and folders with you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Certain features let you make additional information available to others.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Other applications</em>. You can also give third parties access to your information and account - for example, via <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers">Dropbox APIs</a>. Just remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Dropbox Team Admins.</em> If you are a user of a Dropbox 
team (e.g., Dropbox Business plans or Dropbox Education), your 
administrator may have the ability to access and control your Dropbox 
team account. Please refer to your organization's internal policies if 
you have questions about this. If you are not a Dropbox team user but 
interact with a Dropbox team user (by, for example, joining a shared 
folder or accessing stuff shared by that user), members of that 
organization may be able to view the name, email address, profile 
picture, and IP address that was associated with your account at the 
time of that interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Law &amp; Order</em>. We may disclose your information to 
third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably 
necessary to (a) comply with the law; (b) protect any person from death 
or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Dropbox or our 
users; or (d) protect Dropbox's property rights.
    </p>
    <p>
        Stewardship of your data is critical to us and a responsibility 
that we embrace. We believe that our users' data should receive the same
 legal protections regardless of whether it's stored on our services or 
on their home computer's hard drive. We'll abide by the following <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/transparency/principles">Government Request Principles</a> when receiving, scrutinizing and responding to government requests (including national security requests) for our users' data:

        </p><ul>
            <li>Be transparent,</li>
            <li>Fight blanket requests,</li>
            <li>Protect all users and</li>
            <li>Provide trusted services.</li>
        </ul>

        We publish a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/transparency">Transparency Report</a>
 as part of our commitment to informing users about when and how 
governments ask us for information. This report details the types and 
numbers of requests we receive from law enforcement. We encourage users 
to review our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/transparency/principles">Government Request Principles</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/transparency">Transparency Report</a> for more detailed information on our approach and response to government requests.
    <p></p>
    <h2>How</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Security</em>. We have a team dedicated to keeping your 
information secure and testing for vulnerabilities. We also continue to 
work on features to keep your information safe in addition to things 
like two-factor authentication, encryption of files at rest, and alerts 
when new devices and apps are linked to your account.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Retention</em>. We'll retain information you store on our 
Services for as long as we need it to provide you the Services. If you 
delete your account, we'll also delete this information. But please 
note: (1) there might be some latency in deleting this information from 
our servers and back-up storage; and (2) we may retain this information 
if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or 
enforce our agreements. You can access your personal information by 
logging into your Dropbox account. Learn more <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/9022">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Where</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Around the world</em>. To provide you with the Services, we 
may store, process and transmit information in the United States and 
locations around the world - including those outside your country. 
Information may also be stored locally on the devices you use to access 
the Services.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>EU-US Privacy Shield and US-Swiss Safe Harbor.</em> When 
transferring data from the European Union, the European Economic Area, 
and Switzerland, Dropbox relies upon a variety of legal mechanisms, 
including contracts with our users. Dropbox complies with the U.S.-Swiss
 Safe Harbor ("<b>Safe Harbor</b>") framework and its principles. We also participate in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Program ("<b>Privacy Shield</b>") and comply with its framework and principles. You can find Dropbox's Safe Harbor certification <a target="_blank" href="https://safeharbor.export.gov/swisslist.aspx">here</a> and our Privacy Shield certification <a target="_blank" href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/list">here</a>. You can also learn more about Privacy Shield at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">https://www.privacyshield.gov</a> and Safe Harbor at <a target="_blank" href="http://2016.export.gov/safeharbor/swiss/">http://2016.export.gov/safeharbor/swiss/</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dropbox is subject to oversight by the U.S. Federal Trade 
Commission. JAMS is the US-based independent organization responsible 
for reviewing and resolving complaints about our Privacy Shield and Safe
 Harbor compliance — free of charge to you. We ask that you first submit
 any such complaints directly to us via <a target="_blank" href="mailto:privacyshield@dropbox.com">privacyshield@dropbox.com</a>. If you aren't satisfied with our response, please contact JAMS at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield">https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield</a>.
 In the event your concern still isn't addressed by JAMS, you may be 
entitled to a binding arbitration under Privacy Shield and its 
principles.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>
        If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or 
sale of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that 
deal. We will notify you (for example, via a message to the email 
address associated with your account) of any such deal and outline your 
choices in that event.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will 
post the most current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully
 reduces your rights, we will notify you.

        Dropbox Business Agreement
    </h2>
    <p>
        Posted: 30 January 2017
    </p>
    <p>
        This Dropbox Business Agreement (the "<u>Agreement</u>") is 
between Dropbox International Unlimited Company if your organization is 
based outside the United States, Canada and Mexico ("<u>North America</u>") or, if your organization is based in North America, with Dropbox, Inc., a Delaware corporation (each, "<u>Dropbox</u>") and the organization agreeing to these terms ("<u>Customer</u>").
 This Agreement governs access to and use of the Services and Beta 
Services. By clicking "I agree," signing your contract for the Services,
 or using the Services, you agree to this Agreement as a Customer.
    </p>
    <p>
        To the extent that Dropbox, Inc. is, on behalf of the Customer, 
processing Customer Data that is subject to EU Data Protection Laws, by 
clicking "I agree", you are also agreeing to the EU Standard Contractual
 Clauses, defined below, with Dropbox, Inc. for the transfer of personal
 data to processors.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are agreeing to this Agreement and, if applicable, the EU
 Standard Contractual Clauses, for use of the Services by an 
organization, you are agreeing on behalf of that organization. You must 
have the authority to bind that organization to these terms, otherwise 
you must not sign up for the Services.

    <h2>Dropbox Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>Posted: April 12, 2017</p>
    <p>Effective: April 12, 2017</p>

    <p>
        Thanks for using Dropbox! Here we describe how we collect, use 
and handle your information when you use our websites, software and 
services ("<b>Services</b>").
    </p>
    <h2>What &amp; Why</h2>
    <p>
        We collect and use the following information to provide, improve and protect our Services:
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Account</em>. We collect, and associate with your account, 
information like your name, email address, phone number, payment info, 
physical address, and account activity. Some of our services let you 
access your accounts and your information with other service providers.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Services</em>. Our Services are designed to make it simple 
for you to store Your Stuff, collaborate with others, and work across 
multiple devices. To make that possible, we store, process, and transmit
 Your Stuff—like files, messages, comments, and photos—as well as 
information related to it. This related information can be things like 
your <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/63">profile information</a>
 that makes it easier to collaborate and share Your Stuff with others. 
Our Services provide you with different options for sharing Your Stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may choose to give us access to your contacts to make it 
easy for you to do things like share and collaborate on Your Stuff, send
 messages, and invite others to use the Services. If you do, we'll store
 those contacts on our servers for you to use.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Usage</em>. We collect information related to how you use 
the Services, including actions you take in your account (like sharing, 
editing, viewing, and moving files or folders). This helps us provide 
you with features like the "Events" page and version history.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also collect information from and about the devices you use 
to access the Services. This includes things like IP addresses, the type
 of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming 
to our sites, and identifiers associated with your devices. Your devices
 (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to
 the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Cookies and other technologies</em>. We use technologies like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/terms/cookies">cookies and pixel tags</a>
 to provide, improve, protect and promote our Services. For example, 
cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next
 visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and 
improving them based on that information. You can set your browser to 
not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services.
 If our systems receive a DNT:1 signal from your browser, we'll respond 
to that signal as outlined <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/terms/cookies">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>With whom</h2>
    <p>
        We may share information as discussed below, but we won't sell it to advertisers or other third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Others working for Dropbox</em>. Dropbox uses certain 
trusted third parties (for example, providers of customer support and IT
 services) to help us provide, improve, protect, and promote our 
Services. These third parties will access your information only to 
perform tasks on our behalf in compliance with this Privacy Policy, and 
we'll remain responsible for their handling of your information per our 
instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Other users</em>. Our Services display information like your
 name, profile picture, and email address to other users in places like 
your user profile and sharing notifications. When you register your 
Dropbox account with an email address on a domain owned by your employer
 or organization, we may help collaborators find you and your team by 
making some of your basic information—like your name, team name, profile
 picture, and email address—visible to other users on the same domain. 
This helps us show you teams you can join, and helps other users share 
files and folders with you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Certain features let you make additional information available to others.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Other applications</em>. You can also give third parties access to your information and account - for example, via <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers">Dropbox APIs</a>. Just remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Dropbox Team Admins.</em> If you are a user of a Dropbox 
team (e.g., Dropbox Business plans or Dropbox Education), your 
administrator may have the ability to access and control your Dropbox 
team account. Please refer to your organization's internal policies if 
you have questions about this. If you are not a Dropbox team user but 
interact with a Dropbox team user (by, for example, joining a shared 
folder or accessing stuff shared by that user), members of that 
organization may be able to view the name, email address, profile 
picture, and IP address that was associated with your account at the 
time of that interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Law &amp; Order</em>. We may disclose your information to 
third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably 
necessary to (a) comply with the law; (b) protect any person from death 
or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Dropbox or our 
users; or (d) protect Dropbox's property rights.
    </p>
    <p>
        Stewardship of your data is critical to us and a responsibility 
that we embrace. We believe that our users' data should receive the same
 legal protections regardless of whether it's stored on our services or 
on their home computer's hard drive. We'll abide by the following <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/transparency/principles">Government Request Principles</a> when receiving, scrutinizing and responding to government requests (including national security requests) for our users' data:

        </p><ul>
            <li>Be transparent,</li>
            <li>Fight blanket requests,</li>
            <li>Protect all users and</li>
            <li>Provide trusted services.</li>
        </ul>

        We publish a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/transparency/reports">Transparency Report</a>
 as part of our commitment to informing users about when and how 
governments ask us for information. This report details the types and 
numbers of requests we receive from law enforcement. We encourage users 
to review our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/transparency/principles">Government Request Principles</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/transparency/reports">Transparency Report</a> for more detailed information on our approach and response to government requests.
    <p></p>
    <h2>How</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Security</em>. We have a team dedicated to keeping your 
information secure and testing for vulnerabilities. We also continue to 
work on features to keep your information safe in addition to things 
like two-factor authentication, encryption of files at rest, and alerts 
when new devices and apps are linked to your account.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Retention</em>. We'll retain information you store on our 
Services for as long as we need it to provide you the Services. If you 
delete your account, we'll also delete this information. But please 
note: (1) there might be some latency in deleting this information from 
our servers and back-up storage; and (2) we may retain this information 
if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or 
enforce our agreements. You can access your personal information by 
logging into your Dropbox account. Learn more <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/9022">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Where</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Around the world</em>. To provide you with the Services, we 
may store, process and transmit information in the United States and 
locations around the world - including those outside your country. 
Information may also be stored locally on the devices you use to access 
the Services.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield.</em> 
When transferring data from the European Union, the European Economic 
Area, and Switzerland, Dropbox relies upon a variety of legal 
mechanisms, including contracts with our users. Dropbox complies with 
the EU-U.S. and Swiss–U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the
 U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and 
retention of personal information transferred from the European Union, 
the European Economic Area, and Switzerland to the United States. You 
can find Dropbox's Privacy Shield certification <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/list" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. You can also learn more about Privacy Shield at <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dropbox is subject to oversight by the U.S. Federal Trade 
Commission. JAMS is the US-based independent organization responsible 
for reviewing and resolving complaints about our Privacy Shield 
compliance — free of charge to you. We ask that you first submit any 
such complaints directly to us via <a href="mailto:privacyshield@dropbox.com">privacyshield@dropbox.com</a>. If you aren't satisfied with our response, please contact JAMS at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield</a>.
 In the event your concern still isn't addressed by JAMS, you may be 
entitled to a binding arbitration under Privacy Shield and its 
principles.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>
        If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or 
sale of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that 
deal. We will notify you (for example, via a message to the email 
address associated with your account) of any such deal and outline your 
choices in that event.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will 
post the most current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully
 reduces your rights, we will notify you.

    <p>
        Posted: 30 January 2017
    </p>
    <p>
        This Dropbox Business Agreement (the "<u>Agreement</u>") is 
between Dropbox International Unlimited Company if your organization is 
based outside the United States, Canada and Mexico ("<u>North America</u>") or, if your organization is based in North America, with Dropbox, Inc., a Delaware corporation (each, "<u>Dropbox</u>") and the organization agreeing to these terms ("<u>Customer</u>").
 This Agreement governs access to and use of the Services and Beta 
Services. By clicking "I agree," signing your contract for the Services,
 or using the Services, you agree to this Agreement as a Customer.
    </p>
    <p>
        To the extent that Dropbox, Inc. is, on behalf of the Customer,

clicking "I agree", you are also agreeing to the EU Standard Contractual
 Clauses, defined below, with Dropbox, Inc. for the transfer of personal
 data to processors.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are agreeing to this Agreement and, if applicable, the EU
 Standard Contractual Clauses, for use of the Services by an 
organization, you are agreeing on behalf of that organization. You must 
have the authority to bind that organization to these terms, otherwise 
you must not sign up for the Services.

comply with laws and regulations applicable to Customer's use of the 
Services, if any. Customer will obtain and maintain from End Users any
