<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Cookies are small pieces of information that a Web site stores on a visitor's Web browser to remind the site about the visitor the next time they visit the site. PNC does not store confidential or sensitive personal information in cookies. PNC uses cookies to enhance our customers' online banking session by making navigation easier and providing important security features. For certain applications, such as Online Banking, cookies are a requirement because they help protect the privacy of a customer's transactions by, for example, automatically terminating the online session if the customer forgets to log out.</p>
<p>Cookies cannot be used to capture your e-mail address, obtain data from your hard drive or gain confidential or sensitive information about you. Additionally, cookies cannot be read by a Web site other than the one that set the cookie. Some Web sites, however, use cookies to obtain information from your browser. You can set your browser to notify you before accepting a cookie, so that you can control whether you accept or reject a cookie. You will need to manage your cookie settings for each device and browser you use. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preference.</p>
<h2>Click stream auditing</h2>
<p>Click Stream Auditing includes information such as a web surfer's IP address, web pages which have been viewed or acted upon by a web surfer, date and time, domain type, and when a web surfer has responded to an advertisement. We may occasionally combine this information with individual information on an aggregate level to determine the effectiveness of our advertising.</p>
<h2>Action Tags and Other Technologies</h2>
<p>Action Tags are commonly referred to as Web beacons or GIF tags. This type of technology is inserted in various places within our Web site to collect anonymous information about your visits to the PNC site and your interaction with our ads and content. PNC may use certain technologies to collect additional information related to the status and condition of your mobile devices.  This information may be used to support the security of your transaction with PNC, determine industry trends, and for other research purposes.</p>
<h2>Information Use</h2>

We may share personal information when required by law or a subpoena or court order. We may also share personal information when we suspect fraud or for risk management purposes.</p>
<h2>Children</h2>

<h2>Access</h2>
<p>PNC does not maintain a process which allows visitors to review and request changes to any of his or her personally identifiable information, including information that is collected through the use of cookies or other tracking devices, on the Web site or our online service. If you believe that PNC customer records contain any incorrect information about you, please contact us using the customer service contact information provided on your bank or investment statements, or other communications from us pertaining to the products and services you use. You may also contact your local branch, relationship manager, or broker.</p>
<h2>Retention and Destruction</h2>

When the retention period expires, PNC destroys data that was maintained in any form in a manner that renders it completely unusable and incapable of restoration.</p>
<h2>Advertising and Tracking</h2>
<h2>Tracking and Online Advertising</h2>
<p>We use third party advertising and media companies to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. Through the use of cookies and Action Tags (commonly referred to as Web beacons or GIF tags), which are inserted in various places within our Web site, such third party companies may collect anonymous information about your visits to the PNC site and your interaction with our ads and content. For instance, they may keep track of how many of our ads you have seen on other web sites before visiting our Web site. This information is used to understand your browsing behavior and interests so that we can identify your financial needs and provide service and advertising that is tailored to you.</p>
<h2>Behavioral Targeting</h2>
<p>The third party companies we use for online tracking have a network of advertising companies and may share anonymous information about your visits to pnc.com and other Web sites with us, and may use it in order to provide ads about goods and services of interest to you and which would be relevant to you, based on your browsing on PNC.com. From time to time, we may also share anonymous information with such third party companies in an aggregate form, for purposes of analysis and improvement of our Web site. If you would like more information about the use of third-party cookies and tags, or the process of opting out of such cookies or tags, please go to www.networkadvertising.org.</p>
<h2>Geolocation Data</h2>
<p>PNC does not access location data stored on your mobile device without your permission. Some features, such as our Finder application which locates the nearest PNC branch or ATM and shows the best route to get there, will not fully function unless you have enabled access to your location data.</p>
<h2>Social Media</h2>
<h2>Social Media</h2>
<p>PNC maintains information on social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and You Tube. When you post information on PNC social media pages it will be subject to the privacy and security conditions of the social media site. When you log into PNC owned social media properties, we collect information about your activities on those properties. The information we review includes whether you visited or commented on a blog or provided a rating.</p>
<p>PNC mobile applications are not socially enabled and do not allow you to connect to and share information with a community of other users, such as Facebook or Twitter, or the general public, such as You Tube.</p>
<h2>Your Options</h2>
<h2>Online Tracking and Advertising</h2>
<p>PNC uses third-party advertising networks to distribute our advertisements on other websites and mobile applications where we have paid to advertise. These advertisements may use tracking technologies to capture certain information, such as IP address, usage information, or your responsiveness to our advertisements. However, the technologies used do not capture information that identifies you individually. PNC does participate in third party ad network self-regulatory programs for online behavioral advertising.</p>
<p>Pursuant to these programs, PNC honors Do Not Track opt-out preferences that you make to third party advertising networks that we hire to perform online advertising on our behalf. Two examples are the Digital Advertising Alliance's (DAA) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising and DoubleClick. Click on either or both of these links to stop online advertising from PNC by either of these ad programs. You can also help limit the amount of online advertising you receive by visiting www.networkadvertising.org to opt-out of advertising from Network Advertising Initiative member companies.</p>
<p>We do not deliver online advertising to customers that have opted out from the receipt of commercial email from PNC when an online advertising campaign utilizes customer email addresses in connection with a hashing process that anonymously matches our ads to our customers who have a presence on select websites.</p>
<p>PNC does not provide a Do Not Track opt-out mechanism to prevent online advertising to you. Instead, we utilize the established industry mechanisms discussed above.</p>
<p>PNC does not respond to a do-not-track signal from your browser. See www.networkadvertising.org for information on how to opt out from third party cookies or tags. As noted above, when you use PNC's web sites, third parties used by PNC may collect certain information which does not identify you individually on the PNC web sites or on other sites where PNC advertises. Please review the Privacy Policies of all web sites you visit to ascertain the type of information collected on those sites. The type of personal information that PNC collects online about you is identified above under heading Personal Information and Data, subsection: We Collect Personal Information About You When.</p>
<h2>Location Tracking</h2>
<p>Online advertising that relies on location tracking can be prevented by refusing to grant permission to use location data stored on your device. You can also set your device to block access to location data stored on your device. Refer to the user guide for your device.</p>
<h2>Controlling Cookies</h2>
<p>Visit the Federal Trade Commission to learn more about how to limit tracking and online advertising through controlling cookies and other tracking technology that is attached to your browser.</p>
<h2>Joint Marketing</h2>
<p>Joint marketing enables financial institutions to legitimately share customer information with another financial institution under a marketing arrangement to sell financial products and services. This practice is described in PNC's privacy notice, What Does PNC Do With Your Personal Information. Customers may call 1-800-762-2118 to opt out of joint marketing. Online Banking customers may opt out by accessing Privacy Preferences in Customer Service after signing on to Online Banking.</p>
