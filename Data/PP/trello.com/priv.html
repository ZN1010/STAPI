Privacy Policy</h1> <p>Trello,
 Inc. complies with the EU Data Protection Directive through Privacy 
Shield certification and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection 
through the US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework.</p> <h2>WHO WE ARE AND WHAT THIS IS</h2> <p>Trello,
 Inc. (“Trello”) is the producer and owner of Trello (collectively 
referred to here as the/our "Software" or the/our "Services"), which are
 collaborative web and mobile based applications that help teams and 
individuals stay organized and communicate.</p> <p>We take the private 
nature of your personal information very seriously, and are committed to
 protecting it. To do that, we've set up procedures to ensure that your 
information is handled responsibly and in accordance with applicable 
data protection and privacy laws. We're grateful for your trust, and 
we'll act that way.</p> <p>This privacy policy describes what 
information we collect when you visit our Services, how we use that 
information, and what choices we offer you to access, update, and 
control it. This version of the policy is effective as of the latest 
date indicated in the Change Log, below.</p> <h2>PRIVACY SHIELD AND US-SWISS SAFE HARBOR OVERVIEW</h2> <p>Trello,
 Inc., with offices at 55 Broadway, 25th Floor, New York NY 10006, is 
the entity responsible for the management of your Personal Information 
in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Trello, Inc. is a participant in
 the U.S. Department of Commerce's EU-U.S. Privacy Shield program and 
has certified that we adhere to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles. 
Trello, Inc. is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of 
the Federal Trade Commission.</p> <p>For more information about the 
EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of 
Commerce's Privacy Shield website at <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/privacyshield">https://www.commerce.gov/privacyshield</a>.</p> <p>Trello,
 Inc. also complies with the US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework developed by
 the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the Federal Data 
Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland and has certified
 that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. More information
 about the principles that make up the Framework, as well as other 
frequently asked questions relating to Safe Harbor, can be found at: <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>.</p> <h2>TYPES OF INFORMATION</h2> <p><strong>"Personal information"</strong>
 is any information that we could use to identify an individual. It does
 not include personal information that is encoded or anonymized, or 
publicly available information that has not been combined with 
non-public information.</p> <p><strong>"Sensitive personal information"</strong>
 is information that meets the "personal information" criteria and also 
a.) reveals race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or 
philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or b.) concerns health or
 sex life, information about Social Security benefits, or information on
 criminal or administrative proceedings other than in the context of 
pending legal proceedings.</p> <h2>HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION</h2> <p>We collect information two ways: Information we get from your use of our Services, and information you provide to us directly.</p> <p><strong>Information we get from your use of the Services</strong>
 is primarily non-personally-identifying information of the sort that 
web browsers, servers, and services like Google Analytics*, Quantcast 
and Hubspot typically make available, such as the browser type, language
 preference, referring site, and the time of each visit. Other 
non-identifying information that we might have access to includes how 
you use the Service (e.g. search queries), your approximate location, 
cookies, etc.</p> <p>We collect this non-personally-identifying 
information in order to better understand how visitors use the Services 
and, where possible, to improve their experience. For instance, we log 
the time it takes to run database queries so that we can improve 
performance. In some cases, we may publicly display information that is 
not personally identifying in the aggregate, (e.g., by publishing a 
report on trends in the usage of our Services) or may provide the 
aggregate data to third parties.</p> <p>When you use the Services, we 
also collect potentially personally identifying information in the form 
of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) 
accessed (which may reference the name of a board, card, username, or 
team), and the unique identification number associated with the account.
 We don't use that information to identify you, with one exception: we 
may discover, by reviewing log files, that a particular account is using
 the Services in a way that is degrading the experience for all the 
Services’ users. If this is discovered, we may look up personally 
identifiable information associated with that account in order to 
contact the account owner. We handle and disclose this information in 
the same way we handle other potentially personally identifying 
information as described below.</p> <p><strong>Information you provide to us directly.</strong>
 Certain visitors to our Services choose to interact with them in ways 
that may require them to provide us with personally identifying 
information. The amount and type of information that is provided depends
 on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign
 up for our Services to provide a real name, username, and email 
address. Organizations and individuals who engage in financial 
transactions to purchase paid services are asked to provide additional 
information, such as the personal and financial information required to 
process those transactions. In each case, we only collect as much 
information as is necessary or appropriate given the type of 
interaction. We do not disclose personally identifying information other
 than as described below. And you can always refuse to supply personally
 identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent you from 
engaging in certain activities.</p> <p>If you send us a request, such as
 emailing us for support, we reserve the right to publish it (absent any
 personally identifying information) in order to help us clarify or 
respond to your request or help other users.</p> <p>In the process of 
supporting our Services, we may discover personally identifiable 
information associated with your account. The only personally 
identifiable information we may discover during the support process 
without your consent includes your email address and the names of any 
organizations to which you belong. Any further information will not be 
discovered without your consent.</p> <p>In the process of supporting our
 Services, we may need to investigate the data within your account, 
including data you have entered into private boards, cases, wikis, etc. 
If this occurs, we will always request your explicit permission before 
looking at the data in your account.</p> <p>A cookie is a small piece of
 data that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the 
visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.
 We use cookies and other tracking technologies (like Google Analytics) 
to help us recognize your visit and track visitors' use of and 
interaction with the Services. We use Google Analytics to improve our 
site and user experience, and have enabled certain features within 
Google Analytics including their DoubleClick platform, demographic and 
interest reporting, and a remarketing tool. Some of these features, in 
particular the remarketing tool, are advertising features.</p> <p>If you
 do not wish to have cookies placed on your computer, you should set 
your browser to refuse cookies, but should be aware that certain 
features of our Services may not function properly without them. You can
 also visit the Digital Advertising Alliance and the Network Advertising
 Initiative pages to opt-out of cookies. To opt-out of third party 
tracking technologies used on our Services, please do as follows: to opt
 out of Google Analytics, click here (<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>). To opt-out of Quantcast, click here (<a href="https://www.quantcast.com/opt-out/">https://www.quantcast.com/opt-out/</a>). To opt-out of HubSpot, click here (<a href="#" id="hubspotOptOut">Opt out from Hubspot</a>) and unsubscribe from our marketing emails.</p> <p>If
 you are outside the United States, you should know that any personally 
identifiable information you enter into the Services will be transferred
 out of your country and into the United States, and possibly to other 
countries. By using the Services, you consent to such transfer and are 
representing that you have the right to transfer such information 
outside your country.</p> <p>We do not collect any personally 
identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you 
believe that a child has provided us with personally identifiable 
information without the consent of his or her parent or guardian, please
 contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@trello.com">privacy@trello.com</a>. If we become aware that a child under age 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we'll delete it.</p> <h2>INFORMATION YOU CHOOSE TO DISPLAY PUBLICLY ON OUR SERVICES</h2> <p>Some
 users may elect to publicly post personally identifying or sensitive 
information about themselves in their normal use of our Services. This 
could occur through use of optional profile fields, in interactions on 
public boards, wikis, cases and forums, or if a previously private 
interaction is made public. Information like that, which is voluntarily 
posted in publicly visible parts of our Services, is considered to be 
public, even if it would otherwise be considered to be personally 
identifying or sensitive. As such, it is not subject to the protocols 
listed below, because we don't control it; you do. Additionally, 
voluntarily publicizing such information means that you lose any privacy
 rights you might normally have with regards to that information. It may
 also increase your chances of receiving unwanted communications, like 
spam.</p> <p>Please also remember that if you choose to provide 
personally identifiable information using certain public features of the
 Services, individuals reading such information may use or disclose it 
to other individuals or entities without our control and without your 
knowledge, and search engines may index that information. We therefore 
urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you
 may deem private in content that you create or information that you 
submit through our Services.</p> <h2>INFORMATION YOU GIVE TO OTHER PEOPLE</h2> <p>This
 Policy only applies to information collected by Trello. It does not 
apply to the practices of companies that we don't own or control, or 
employees that we don't manage. Information on our Services’ boards, 
wikis, cases and forums may contain links to third party websites, and 
any information you provide to those sites will be covered by any 
privacy policies they may have. Please be sure to read the privacy 
policies of any third-party sites you visit. It is those sites' 
responsibility to protect any information you give them, so we can't be 
held liable for their wrongful use of your personally identifying 
information.</p> <h2>HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2> <p><strong>Notice</strong>
 — Notice is what this privacy policy that you're reading is all about. 
You are reading it, right? It's important! When we collect your personal
 information, we'll tell you how we're using it, any types of third 
parties to which we might disclose it, (other than "agents," such as 
vendors or contractors, who are only processing such information for us 
or at our direction), and the choices we offer you to limit the use of 
your information.</p> <p>Notice will be provided in clear and 
conspicuous language when you are first asked to provide us with 
personal information, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and we'll 
notify you before we use the information for something other than the 
purpose for which it was originally collected. If anything in this 
policy seems unclear, please don't hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@trello.com">privacy@trello.com</a>, so we can address your question and possibly clarify this document.</p> <p>Although
 most changes are likely to be minor, we may occasionally need to change
 this policy. If we do update it, we'll notify you either by posting the
 new policy on our Services, their blogs, or by emailing you the changes
 or a link to the modified document. (See the "Choice" section below for
 information about how we'll notify you if we change our policy 
regarding sensitive information.) In any case, the way we use 
information you provide will be covered by the privacy policy that was 
in effect at the time it was collected.</p> <p><strong>Here are some of the ways we may use personal information you provide us:</strong></p> <ul> <li>To allow you to register for our Services and to administer and process the registration</li> <li>To communicate with you about our products, services and related issues</li> <li>To evaluate the quality of our products and services, and to enhance your experience on our web sites</li> <li>To maintain and administer our web sites and comply with our legal or internal obligations and policies</li> <li>To
 transfer information to others as described in this policy or to 
satisfy our legal, regulatory, compliance, or auditing requirements, 
including to disclose information to law enforcement authorities upon 
validly served legal process or a valid judicial instruction (for 
example, pursuant to a court order)</li> <li>To charge you any fees and provide you with a receipt or resolve billing issues associated with your account</li> <li>In
 the case of accounts created using business email domains, to provide 
your contact information to an administrator of the business email 
domain to facilitate the provision of additional products and/or 
services</li> </ul> <p><strong>Choice</strong> — Choice is all about 
making sure you have the ability to control how we share your personal 
information with others. We never share any of your personal information
 with non-agent third parties.</p> <p>We won't share your personal 
information with non-agent third parties unless we are required to do so
 by law, or if we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably 
necessary to protect our property, rights or those of third parties or 
the public at large. It is possible that we may, on occasion, buy or 
sell assets from or to other companies. If that should occur, user 
information is typically one of the assets that gets transferred. 
Similarly, if Trello or most of its assets were acquired, or in the 
unlikely event that we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user 
information could be transferred or acquired. You should be aware that 
such events can occur, and that if it does, the buyer may continue to 
use your personal and non-personal information, but only as set forth in
 this policy. Other than in these rare circumstances, Trello will not 
rent or sell potentially personally identifying information to anyone.</p> <p>We
 may from time to time request some of your financial information for 
the purposes of completing transactions you have initiated through the 
Services, enrolling you in discount, rebate, and other programs in which
 you elect to participate, protecting against or identify possible 
fraudulent transactions, and otherwise as needed to manage our business.</p> <p>It's
 hard to imagine that we would ever consider collecting, let alone 
sharing, sensitive information with a non-agent third party, but if such
 a day should come, we will first give you the opportunity to explicitly
 consent (opt-in) to such disclosure or to any use of the information 
for a purpose other than the one for which it was originally collected 
or previously authorized.</p> <p>If you are a registered user of our 
Services and have supplied your email address, we may occasionally send 
you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or 
just keep you up to date with what's going on with the Services. We 
generally use our Services to communicate this type of information, so 
we expect to keep this type of communication to a minimum. If we do send
 you information that you did not expressly request, we will provide you
 with a way to request that you don't get any similar notices (opt-out, 
unsubscribe, etc.).</p> <p><strong>Onward Transfer</strong> — Prior to 
providing agents with any personal information, we will obtain 
assurances that they will safeguard it in accordance with this policy. 
Examples of assurances that may be provided include: </p><ul> <li>A 
commitment that they will handle the information in accordance with this
 policy, or will provide the same level of protection, as required by 
the Privacy Shield Principles, subject to EU Directive 95/46/EC ("the EU
 Data Protection Directive");</li> <li>Privacy Shield certification by the agent, or being subject to another European Commission adequacy finding.</li> </ul> <p>In
 the unlikely event that we should discover that an agent is using 
personal information in a way that conflicts with this policy, we will 
take all reasonable steps to stop it immediately.</p> <p>In cases of 
onward transfer to third parties of data of EU individuals received 
pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield, Trello will remain liable.</p> <p><strong>Security</strong>
 — All records containing personal or financial information are 
considered to be our property and are afforded confidential treatment at
 all times. We work hard to protect against the unauthorized access, 
use, alteration or destruction of personal or financial information. All
 such electronic information is stored on restricted database servers, 
and is generally kept until such time as you may ask us to edit or 
delete it, as described below. We only disclose such information to our 
employees, contractors or affiliates that a) need to know that 
information in order to process it for us or to provide other services, 
and b) have agreed not to disclose it to others.</p> <p>All interactions
 with our Services use the Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer
 (TLS/SSL) protocol. We use a third-party, industry-accepted Payment 
Gateway to securely process credit card transactions.</p> <p><strong>Data Integrity</strong>
 — In addition to assuring you that we will protect your personal 
information, we also want to make sure that it is reliable, accurate, 
and up-to-date. In order to do that, we provide:</p> <p><strong>Access</strong>
 — Upon request, we will provide you with reasonable access to the 
personal information we collect about you. Because personal 
information—for example, your email address—is required to use The 
Services, we retain personal information as long as your account is 
active. You will have the opportunity to correct, update, modify or 
delete this information updating your information in The Services. 
Please note that some information may remain in our records even after 
you request deletion of your information, to the extent permitted by the
 Privacy Shield Principles. Additionally, there may be limits to the 
amount of information we can practically provide. For example, we may 
limit an individual's access to personal information where the burden or
 expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to 
the individual's privacy or where doing so would violate others' rights.</p> <p><strong>Enforcement</strong>
 — We will conduct internal audits of our compliance with this privacy 
policy, including an annual self-assessment. Our employees take your 
privacy as seriously as we do, and we will take all reasonable measures 
against any employee found to be in violation of this policy.</p> <p>If you have any concerns or complaints about how you think we've handled your personal information, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@trello.com">privacy@trello.com</a>
 or our Data Protection Officer at the address below. We will work hard 
to investigate and resolve any complaints you might have.</p> <p>We hope
 it won't ever come to this, but if you've already contacted us and feel
 that your complaint cannot be resolved between the two of us, you can 
also submit your complaint to Privacy Trust, an independent third party.
 Visit <a href="https://www.privacytrust.com/drs/trello">https://www.privacytrust.com/drs/trello</a>
 to file a complaint. Finally, as a last resort and in limited 
situations, EU individuals may seek redress from the Privacy Shield 
Panel, a binding arbitration mechanism.</p> <h2>TRELLO AND INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM CHILDREN</h2> <p>Trello
 does not knowingly collect personal information from children without 
parental consent. If we learn that we have inadvertently obtained 
information in violation of applicable laws, we will promptly delete the
 information. For more information on Trello's approach to children's 
use of Trello (including our compliance with the U.S. Children's Online 
Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), please see the section of our <a href="https://trello.com/legal#kids" title="Trello Terms of Service">Terms of Service</a> called "Kids Under 13 and Trello."</p> <h2>HOW TO CONTACT US</h2> <p>If you have any questions about this policy or our site in general, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@trello.com">privacy@trello.com</a>.</p> <p>Our Data Protection Officer is Brian Schmidt.</p> <p>Written Inquiries can be sent to:</p> <p> Trello<br> One Exchange Plaza, 25th Floor<br> New York, NY 10006<br> USA </p> <h2>Security</h2> <p>Please see the <a href="https://trello.com/security">Trello Security Policy</a>.</p> <h2>EMPLOYEES' &amp; PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES' INFORMATION</h2> <p>This
 section covers any ways in which personal information we collect from 
employees or applicants might be treated differently than user 
information. You can probably stop here if you are not an employee or 
interested in applying for a job with Trello. But maybe you should be 
interested: Who wouldn't want to work with an amazingly talented team 
dedicated to making awesome software, especially at a company with free 
lunches, top-notch benefits, and a founder who has literally written <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1590598385/">the book</a>
 on how to make great workplaces for building amazing software? The more
 I think about it, the more I think maybe you should click here after 
all: <a href="https://trello.com/jobs"> https://trello.com/jobs</a>. And
 if you do, be sure to review the following non-comprehensive list of 
ways that we may use information provided to us by employees or 
applicants:</p> <ul> <li>Responding to inquiries in connection with prospective employment at Trello, and processing employment applications</li> <li>Carrying
 out human resources functions like training, career / succession 
planning, administering contracts, evaluating employees, and providing 
benefits</li> <li>Enabling Trello and its employees to contact each other by telephone, fax, e-mail, or "snail mail"</li> <li>Administering compensation, bonus and other employment needs</li> <li>Arranging employees' travel plans</li> <li>Maintaining building security and employee health and safety</li> <li>Running internal administrative analytics, such as staffing, headcount and statistics initiatives</li> <li>Complying with our legal obligations, policies and procedures</li> <li>Transferring personal information to others as required by our legal, regulatory, compliance and auditing needs</li> </ul> <p>* Google Analytics is a registered trademark of Google, Inc.</p> <a href="https://www.privacytrust.com/cert/796765.html" target="_blank"><img src="priv_files/796765_lg.jpe" alt="PrivacyTrust Privacy Shield Certification: Click to Verify" border="0"></a> <h2>Change Log</h2> <ul> <li>1/5/17:
