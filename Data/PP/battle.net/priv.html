<h3>Blizzard Entertainment® Online Privacy Policy<a id="h3l0"></a></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.esrb.org/confirm/blizzard-confirmation.aspx"><img src="priv_files/esrb-click.png" alt="Online Privacy Compliance Seal ESRB" title="Online Privacy Compliance Seal ESRB"></a></p>
<p>Blizzard Entertainment and its affiliate companies (collectively 
"Blizzard") respect the privacy of its on-line visitors and recognize 
the importance of providing a secure environment for them. We have 
adopted a company-wide On-Line Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) that 
explainshow we collect, store, and use the information you provide us. 
This Privacy Policy details how Blizzard safeguards the privacy of its 
on-line visitors and does not apply to information that may be collected
 by Blizzard off-line. Please note that when you click a link to other 
sites from a Blizzard website, this Privacy Policy does not apply to, 
and cannot control the activities on, those other sites.  We highly 
recommend that you read the privacy policy of any third party website 
you may be directed to before providing any personally identifiable 
information.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy and the certification seals shown on our websites
 confirm that Blizzard is a valid licensee, and participating member, in
 good standing of the <a href="http://www.esrb.org/privacy/faq.aspx#10">Entertainment Software Rating Board’s Privacy Certified Program</a>
 (“ESRB Privacy Certified”). ESRB Privacy Certified is designed to 
ensure that our information collection, use and disclosure practices are
 responsible and appropriate. To protect your privacy, we have 
voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative, and all of our websites 
where this Privacy Policy is posted have been reviewed and certified by 
ESRB Privacy Certified to meet established online information 
collection, use and disclosure practices.</p>
<p>If you are a visitor from outside the United States, the personal 
information you provide may be transferred to, stored, and processed 
within the United States or other countries where Blizzard maintains 
facilities or business operations.</p>
<p>By using this website and/or any of Blizzard’s online products or 
services, you signify your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not 
agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use our websites. This 
Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please check back 
periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes. If we make a 
material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting 
the change on our websites or in this Privacy Policy and, if necessary, 
give you additional choices regarding such change prior to the change 
becoming effective. Your continued use of the Blizzard websites will 
signify your acceptance of these changes.</p>

<h3>1.	What personal information is collected?<a id="h3l1"></a></h3>
<p>If an on-line visitor submits information to Blizzard, it will 
usually take the form of either: (1) the purchase of goods or services 
though our on-line stores, (2) product or account registration, or 
registration for on-line game participation, (3) player match-up 
services, (4) message boards or forums, (5) eCards or Recruit-a-Friend 
e-mails, (6) warranty registrations, (7) contest registrations, (8) a 
consumer complaint, (9) surveys, (10) customer service or technical 
support, (11) Share Wish List feature, and/or (12) newsletters. Personal
 information collected may include your name, home address, phone 
number, and/or e-mail address. We do not require this information to 
gain access to our websites, however, you will not be able to utilize 
certain products, services, or features that require registration or 
receive materials such as newsletters unless such information is 
provided.</p>
<p>If you register an account using your Facebook account, the following
 information may be collected: (1) your first and last name and other 
information made publicly available by you, (2) your friends list, and 
(3) the email address associated with your account.</p>
<p>Some of our websites and/or online services require you to create an 
account with a third party service provider. For example, users are 
required to create a Mashery ID in order to use our development website.
 The username and email address that you create through this platform 
are collected by both Blizzard and Mashery. In these types of instances,
 we strongly encourage you to also review the privacy practices of the 
third party prior to divulging any personal information.</p>
<p>Visitors purchasing products or services will be required to provide 
additional information such as a valid credit card number, expiration 
date, and shipping and billing addresses.</p>
<p>Please note that, depending on the Blizzard website that you are 
visiting, many of the activities listed above may not be available and, 
as such, personal information may not be collected.</p>

<a href="#h3menu">Back to top</a>

<h3>2.	What other types of information may we collect?<a id="h3l2"></a></h3>
<p>For some activities, we may ask you to create a username and password
 and/or to provide other personal and non-personal information including
 but not limited to your age, date of birth, gender, and/or game and 
platform preferences; and, we may combine such information with other 
personal and/or non-personal information. In addition, your web browser 
or client software may transmit certain geographic information or 
information regarding your computer (capabilities, game data processing,
 etc.) to Blizzard. Blizzard may use this information to generate 
aggregate statistics about our user community and may provide such 
information to advertisers and/or our partners. In addition, Blizzard 
may use such information for security, system integrity (the prevention 
of hacking, cheats, etc.), or enforcement purposes. From time to time, 
we may also post customer testimonials that contain personally 
identifiable information on Blizzard’s websites. However, we will obtain
 the customer’s consent to post these testimonials prior to publication 
in accordance with the applicable Blizzard agreement.</p>

<a href="#h3menu">Back to top</a>

<h3>3.	How do we use your personal information?<a id="h3l3"></a></h3>
<p>The personal information you provide Blizzard will allow us to 
fulfill your product or service order; alert you of new products or 
services, features, or enhancements; handle/route your customer service 
or technical support questions or issues; to send eCards or 
“Recruit-a-Friend” emails; and/or notify you of upgrade opportunities, 
contests, promotions, or special events and offers. Blizzard may enhance
 or merge the personal information collected at a Blizzard website with 
data from third parties in order to update your contact information, 
perform market analysis, or improve our products, services, or systems. 
Blizzard may also provide your personal information to other companies 
or organizations that offer products or services that may be of interest
 to you. In such cases, we will notify you that the information will be 
shared and provide you with an opportunity to opt-out.</p>
<p>Lastly, we may use your personal information for internal marketing, 
profiling, or demographic purposes, so we can adapt our products and 
services to better suit your needs. We do this to better understand and 
serve our customers.</p>
<p>Please be advised that personal information submitted by individuals 
acting solely in a business capacity (e.g., personal information 
contained in job applicant's resume) is not subject to the uses set 
forth above or to any other practices stated in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<a href="#h3menu">Back to top</a>

<h3>4.	What type of communications may you receive?<a id="h3l4"></a></h3>

<u>Special Offers and Updates</u>
<p>We will occasionally send you information on products, services, 
special deals, and promotions. Out of respect for your privacy, we 
present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please 
see the “Choice” section below.</p>

<u>Service-related Announcements</u>
<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare 
occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is
 temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. 
Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not 
promotional in nature.</p>

<u>Customer Service</u>
<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we
 will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. 
We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to 
provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will 
communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your 
wishes.</p>

<u>Recruit a Friend/E-cards/Share Wish List</u>
<p>If you choose to use our recruit-a-friend, Share Wish List, or e-card
 features, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We 
will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her
 to visit the website. Blizzard does not store this information and uses
 it for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and to track the
 success of our referral program.</p>

<a href="#h3menu">Back to top</a>

<h3>5.	Who is collecting your information?<a id="h3l5"></a></h3>
<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website, you 
are sharing that information with Blizzard, its parent, and its various 
affiliates and sister companies, unless specifically stated otherwise. 
As a result of this sharing, you may receive communications from any of 
Blizzard's affiliates. From time to time, Blizzard may use third party 
contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf 
(for product and prize fulfillment, credit card processing, etc.).</p>
<p>In addition, some services are provided in conjunction with partner 
companies. If your personal information is being collected by a company 
other than Blizzard and not on Blizzard’s behalf, you will be notified 
at the time the information is collected. If you do not want your 
information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of 
information by not using that particular service or by not providing any
 information at that time.</p>
<p>Please be aware that we cannot control the activities of third 
parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they
 adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will
 take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will provide 
sufficient protection of personal information.</p>
<p>Please be aware that advertisers or websites with links to and from 
our websites may collect personal information about you. And remember, 
this Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control the activities
 of, those other advertisers or websites. We encourage you to carefully 
read the privacy policy of any advertiser or website you visit.</p>
<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the 
Facebook "Like" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or 
interactive mini-programs that run on our websites. These features may 
collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are 
visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to 
function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted 
by a third party or hosted directly on our websites. Your interactions 
with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company 
providing it.</p>

<a href="#h3menu">Back to top</a>

<h3>6.	With whom may your personal information be shared?<a id="h3l6"></a></h3>
<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only
 in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy. We do not sell 
your personal information to third parties. We may, however, share 
non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with 
third parties. Additionally, we share unique identifiers specific to 
your device with third parties for the purpose of tailoring content as 
well as personalizing, adjusting and improving our services.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as 
required by law or in special cases when we have reason to believe that 
disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring 
legal action against you if you are violating the Terms of Service or 
Use Agreements for a Blizzard website or product, or may be causing 
injury to or interference (intentionally or unintentionally) with 
Blizzard's rights or property, other users of a Blizzard website or 
product, or anyone else who could be harmed by your activities. We also 
reserve the right to disclose your personal information if we have a 
good faith belief that it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal
 activities.</p>
<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of 
Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records. As such, 
we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we 
decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can 
continue to receive service and information in connection with that line
 of business with as little disruption as possible. Similarly, in the 
event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other 
similar event, your personal information may be transferred to 
Blizzard's successor or assign.</p>
<p>Blizzard websites may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat 
areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another. 
When posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, please be aware 
that the information is being made publicly available on-line and the 
user does so at his or her own risk. For certain forums, anyone posting 
or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, 
their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the 
name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real 
ID below). If your personal information is posted on one of our 
community forums, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@blizzard.com">privacy@blizzard.com</a>&nbsp;to
 request removal. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your 
personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are 
unable to do so and why.</p>

<a href="#h3menu">Back to top</a>

<h3>7.	What choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?<a id="h3l7"></a></h3>
<p>Blizzard allows you to control the way that we use personally 
identifying information that we might obtain. At the time you provide 
personal information, Blizzard may give you the option of declining any 
future offers or information about new products, promotions, or 
services. In addition, many of the "mailings" Blizzard may send you, 
such as newsletters, have procedures within them to cancel the receipt 
of any future mailings. Lastly, you may be given the opportunity to 
"opt-out" of certain features or functionality (e.g. Real ID). See the 
applicable feature's FAQ or information page for more details.</p>

<a href="#h3menu">Back to top</a>

<h3>8.	California Residents: Your California Privacy Rights<a id="h3l8"></a></h3>
<p>Under California law, our customers that are California residents may
 request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal 
information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. As 
detailed above, we do not share our customer's personal information with
 unaffiliated third parties for direct marketing purposes without their 
approval.
</p><p>If at any time you wish to opt out of having your personal 
information shared with third parties and/or receiving information from 
Blizzard (via e-mail or postal mail) about new products, services, or 
promotions, you can do so. You may contact us at Blizzard Entertainment 
Privacy Policy, Attn: Opt-Out Administrator, One Blizzard Way, Irvine, 
CA 92618-3616. You can also contact us by e-mailing us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:opt-out@blizzard.com">opt-out@blizzard.com</a>. Please indicate what publications or services you no longer wish to receive so that we may better address your needs.
</p><p><b>California Privacy Rights for Minors</b></p>
<p>California residents under the age of 18 have the right to remove, or
 request the removal of, content or information they have posted to the 
message boards or forums. This request can be made by contacting us at 
Blizzard Entertainment Privacy Policy, Attention: Privacy Policy 
Administrator, One Blizzard Way, Irvine, CA 92618-3616. We can also be 
reached via e-mail at <a href="mailto:privacy@blizzard.com">privacy@blizzard.com</a>.
 Please again be advised that any information posted to the message 
boards or forums is publicly viewable. We strongly recommend that all 
users avoid posting personal or sensitive information at any time.</p>
<p>Please note that residual copies of content and/or information that 
have been deleted may remain on our backup servers. We are not required 
to remove posted content or information if it has been rendered 
anonymous or if we are required by law to retain it. Additionally, we do
 not have control over third parties (e.g., other users) who may have 
copied or reposted the content or information.</p>

<a href="#h3menu">Back to top</a>

<h3>9.	What about Children?<a id="h3l9"></a></h3>
<p><b><u>Children Under 13</u></b></p>
<p>Once a child states that his/her age is under 13, they will be unable
 to register an account with us. We do not knowingly collect or store 
any personally identifiable information from children under 13. If 
parents believe that we have unintentionally collected their childrens’ 
personal information, they may request the deletion of the information 
by contacting us at Blizzard Entertainment Privacy Policy, Attention: 
Privacy Policy Administrator, One Blizzard Way, Irvine CA 92618-3616. 
They may also e-mail us at <a href="mailto:privacy@blizzard.com">privacy@blizzard.com</a>.</p>
<p><b><u>Note to Parents</u></b></p>
<p>We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information 
about young children. We urge parents to instruct their children to 
never give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without 
permission, when on-line. Teenagers under the age of 17 and over the age
 of 12 should encourage their parents to review this policy and to 
contact us if they would like to evoke our opt-out policy or to raise 
any concerns. For more information, you may visit our Parental Controls 
area at <a href="https://us.battle.net/account/parental-controls/index.html">https://us.battle.net/account/parental-controls/index.html</a>.</p>

<a href="#h3menu">Back to top</a>

<h3>10.	What is Real ID?<a id="h3l10"></a></h3>
<p>Real ID friends can see each other’s real-life name and can see each 
other’s characters across all Blizzard products and services. By 
participating in Real ID, you will have the option of making your real

<h3>11.	What is Global Play?<a id="h3l11"></a></h3>
<p>Certain Blizzard games feature "Global Play," which allows you to 
play with other players who are outside of the region associated with 
the creation of your Blizzard account. The Global Play feature requires 
that some or all of the personal information that you provided when you 
created your Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by 
Blizzard in the regions where you wish to play.</p>

<h3>12.	What are tracking technologies and how are they used?<a id="h3l12"></a></h3>
<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information 
automatically and store it in log files. This information may include a 
unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and 
non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service 
Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp,
 and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected 
log information with other information we collect about you. We do this 
to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, 
or website functionality.</p>
<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (<a href="http://us.blizzard.com/company/about/marketing-partners.html">listed here</a>),
 may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and 
scripts. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering 
the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to 
gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may 
receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these 
companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.</p>
<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to 
remember users’ settings (e.g. language preference), and for 
authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual 
browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, 
but your ability to use some features or areas of our websites may be 
limited.</p>
<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know 
which e-mails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge 
the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our
 marketing campaigns. For this reason, these types of clear gifs are 
tied to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain 
features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web 
browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and 
Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and 
preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for 
removing HTML5. To manage Flash cookies, please&nbsp;<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">click here</a>.</p>
<p>We partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising
 on our websites or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad 
network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information 
about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted
 advertising based upon your interests. Some of these ad networks are 
members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the 
Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single 
location to opt out of receiving tailored ads. If you wish to not have 
your information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you 
may opt-out by&nbsp;visiting the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">DAA's Consumer Choice page</a> and/or the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page</a>.
 Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You 
will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads. Please also note
 that we strive to adhere to the <a href="http://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/sites/digital.daaoperations.org/files/DAA_files/seven-principles-07-01-09.pdf">DAA's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising</a>.</p>

<h3>13.	What are Internet Protocol addresses?<a id="h3l13"></a></h3>
<p>An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to 
your server or Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). Blizzard may track 
such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate 
information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers
 from being abused. See tracking technology discussion above.</p>

<h3>15.	How secure is my personal information?<a id="h3l15"></a></h3>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. 
Blizzard has taken steps to assure that all information collected will 
remain secure and in its original form, i.e. free from any alteration. 
As such, access to all personal information is strictly controlled. When
 credit card information is transmitted, for example, we use industry 
standard, SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption. We follow generally 
accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, 
both during transmission and once it is received.</p>
<p>In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third 
parties to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection 
of personal information.</p>
