may need to be taken when information has been collected from children 
under 18. In those instances where a CBS Interactive Service has actual 
knowledge that it collects information from children or offers a service
 directed toward children as defined under applicable laws, it will 
comply with those laws. To read about our privacy policy for children, 
please see the <a href="https://www.cbsinteractive.com/legal/cbsi/privacy-policy/childrens-privacy-policy">Children's Privacy Policy</a>.
