    <div><h1>Privacy Statement</h1><br><p>The Privacy Statement (the “Statement”) that follows describes the collection, use and disclosure of information practices by Apartments.com and its affiliates (“us” or “we”) in connection with the operation of our websites www.apartments.com, www.apartmenthomeliving.com, and our related mobile applications, (collectively, the “Site”). This Statement applies to the national version of Apartments.com as well as to any other versions or pages of Apartments.com that we operate, including a version of the Site that you may have arrived at from a distribution partner’s website.
    <br><br>This Statement does not describe the collection, use and disclosure of information through means other than the Site (e.g., offline) or the collection, use and disclosure practices of any third party, including Apartments.com’s distribution partners. For information on a third party’s information collection, use and disclosure practices, please review the privacy policy on the applicable third party’s website. Also, please note that this Site may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the websites, content or privacy practices of any third party. By using this Site, you acknowledge that you have read this Statement and agree that you are bound by Terms of Service, which form a legally binding contract between you and us. 
    <br><br>The policy that follows is applicable to our information collection, use and disclosure practices.
</p><h2>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information</h2><p>You are not required to provide any personally identifiable information to visit the Site. We automatically collect Usage Data (as described below) and may collect ZIP codes and other information in connection with your use of the Site (e.g., the type of apartment you are looking for). We collect personally identifiable information only when you provide it. You may be required to provide personally identifiable information to use certain services. In addition, you may submit personally identifiable information in other ways, including: (a) participating in online surveys, promotions, contests and sweepstakes; (b) subscribing to newsletters, editorial content, or promotional content sent via email (which have opt-out instructions if you wish to unsubscribe); (c) submitting reviews or other content to the Site; and (d) in connection with other products, services, features, or requests made available through the Site. We also publish toll-free phone numbers for many of the apartment listings on the Site. By dialing one of these phone numbers, you consent to the Site or a service provider operating on the Site’s behalf recording the date, time and length of your call and the phone number from which the call originated, along with the call itself and other information that may be captured. Any Usage Data and/or personally identifiable information resulting from such calls may be used as described in this Statement, including for follow up marketing purposes. The types of personally identifiable information collected will depend on the nature of the submission or the features of the Site used, but could include your name, address, phone number, and/or email address.

</p><h2>Passive Information Collection</h2><p>The Site automatically collects information and may also customize your visit through technical means, including the following:
</p><ol><li><strong>Cookies</strong>: Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer’s hard drive by computers (or servers) to identify your computer.</li><li><strong>Web Beacons</strong>: Web beacons (also known as pixel tags, Internet tags, clear GIFs, or single-pixel GIFs) are electronic images embedded into a Web page. </li><li><strong>IP Address Logs</strong>: Apartments.com, also logs Internet Protocol (IP) addresses – the location of your computer on the Internet.</li></ol><p>Cookies allow us to recognize you when you visit the Site, to personalize your experience and generally to serve you better. For example, if you enter your name, address or ZIP code on one of the Site’s forms, it may be stored in a cookie so you do not have to enter it again on other forms on the Site. Cookies and Web beacons (which may be placed by us or a third party tracking utility partner) can tell us what advertising you have seen on the Site, which allows us to offer you a more diverse selection of advertising information and may also be used together to measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. Cookies, Web beacons and IP addresses are also used to compile data regarding Site usage (what Web site you came from, what pages of the Site you visit, how long you were on the Site, what type of browser you are using, what Web site did you go to, etc.). This type of tracking does not identify you personally. Web beacons may also be included in emails sent by the Site to determine when and if such emails are opened or forwarded. You can disable cookies or otherwise manage them through tools provided with your browser software and with third-party software packages. If you turn off cookies, many of the Site’s features will not work as well or at all. Anonymous information regarding usage of our Site and services that is collected and/or aggregated by or on behalf of Apartments.com through the use of such technical means or otherwise is referred to in this Statement as <strong>“Usage Data.”</strong> The use of third party cookies is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

If you request information or services through the Site, you agree that the Site may share personally identifiable information as may be necessary to provide such information to or perform such services for you.

Service Providers. The Site works with third parties that provide services on its behalf. Examples include providers of analytical, development, promotional, research, review moderation, and other services. For example, the Site may ask that a third party conduct an online survey or sweepstakes or send newsletters or advertising on its behalf.

The Site reserves the right to share any personally identifiable information you post on the Site with third parties with your prior consent. To the extent the Site does so, the subsequent use and disclosure of such information is subject to the privacy policies and practices of those third parties.


    <br><br>Please note that the messages that the Site sends to you to confirm, fulfill, or follow up on a request may incidentally include promotional material or other content from the Site or its partners.

When we execute such searches on your behalf we do not transfer your identity or personally identifiable information to third parties, other than the rental property owners. This information is not used to create a profile about you or your activities. Your location is only stored in the app if you save your location (rental property) searches and may be deleted by you by clearing your search history.

For example, you may include a phone number and/or an email address to allow users to contact you regarding your listing. As such, you may receive unsolicited phone calls and emails from third parties, even after your listing is no longer on the Site. Except for required information, you should not include any contact or other information in your listing that you do not want other parties to see or use. If you wish to access, verify the accuracy of, or change the personally identifiable information in your advertisement, you can use the interface available at http://www.apartments.com/add-edit-listing/.
