<p>Functionality cookies allow the website to remember your online settings (such as your user name, language or location) and provide enhanced, more personalised features.</p>
<p>These cookies can also be used to remember changes you made to text size, fonts and other parts of a web page that you can customize. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for or to prevent you from receiving services you have already refused.</p>
<p>These types of cookies may be first party or third party. Presently we only use first party cookies, and they can be session or permanent.</p>
<p>When you choose functionalities and services, you agree to our use of the related functionality cookie.</p>
<h2>B - Profiling Cookies</h2>
<p>These cookies, that include advertising and targeting cookies, are used by Gucci, our advertising providers and/or third parties to offer you a customised browsing experience by delivering you advertisements that are relevant to you and your interests on third party websites. We use cookies to identify your preferences and analyse your online interactions and transactions with us, but use that information exclusively for the benefit of Gucci and do not share it with any third party, except with Gucci service providers for the purpose of processing it on our behalf.</p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, especially if you are logged-in on your account, we may combine data collected through the cookies with your personal data for the purposes set out above, unless you have explicitly refused to be the subject of such processing and you have opted out from these types of cookies. We invite you to read our privacy policy for full details of how we can process your personal data under such circumstances.</p>
<p>Among the many types of advertising or targeting cookies, we may use Flash Cookies and Pixel Tags:</p>
<p>Flash Cookies: We may use local shared objects, known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences. The amount and type of information collected through Flash cookies and how they work is different from browser cookies. Please be aware that the browser's tools to manage cookies will not remove Flash cookies. To disable flash cookies, please use the setting tool provided by the Flash player here.</p>
<p>Pixel Tags: If you agreed to being tracked and/or profiled, we may use other tracking technologies (e.g., web beacons, clear gifs) in the communications we send to you. The purpose of these may be to learn about whether you have read or opened the email, whether you have interacted with any link, e.g., by clicking on it, and if so which ones. This information may be combined with other information we have gathered about you, to help us deliver more interesting communications to you, based on your browsing experience and shopping.</p>
<p>You can read more about the cookie policy of the third party partners whose profiling cookies are used on our site by clicking here. U.S. residents can learn more about their choices for not having their information used by certain third parties by clicking here.</p>
<p>At any time you can manage your preferences for advertising or targeting cookies through your browser settings as per section 6 below, or by enabling/disabling all third party cookies as per section 7 below.</p>
<h2>5. Information sharing</h2>
<p>We do not share information collected through the use of cookies and pixel tags with any third party, except with other companies within Kering Group of Companies, our advertising agencies/providers and our IT service providers (e.g., hosting providers), exclusively for the purposes set out above.</p>
<h2>6. How to manage your tracking and cookie preferences</h2>
<p>At any time, you have the option to limit this tracking or to accept or decline the use of cookies/pixel tags by changing your browser application settings. Please note that our systems may not recognize Do Not Track headers or requests from some or all browsers. You may learn more by checking our California Do-Not-Track Disclosures.</p>
<p>Most browser applications automatically accept cookies but you can set it to receive an alert each time an operator tries to send you cookies/pixel tags, and/or prevent it from accepting them. On most browsers, the “Help” portion of the toolbar will tell you how to prevent it from accepting cookies, how to change your tracking settings, how to have it notify you when you receive cookies/pixel tags, or how to disable cookies/pixel tags altogether.</p>
<p>Below are pages describing these settings in more detail for each browser:</p>
<p>Chrome</p>
<p>Firefox</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 7 en 8</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 9</p>
<p>Safari</p>
<p>Opera</p>
<p>If you use multiple browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.) you must repeat this procedure with each one, and if you connect to the web from multiple devices (e.g., from work and at home), then you will need to set your preferences on each browser on each device.</p>
<p>Please note that if you disable completely cookies from the browser, then it is possible that some parts of our website will not function properly such as the normal surfing or the purchase activity, and finally you may also lose any personalized activity, and the advertising you receive when you visit this website will not be tailored to your interests.</p>
