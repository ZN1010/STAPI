<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<div>Last Updated (07/21/2017)</div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome! Your privacy is important to Kia Motors America, Inc. (“Kia” or “we,” “our” or “us”). This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes how we collect, use, and share information when you use the online services that we own, operate, or make available and that link to the Privacy Policy (e.g., websites such as Kia.com and kia-cpo.com and certain of our mobile websites, mobile applications, downloads, and interactive features). The Privacy Policy also describes how we use, and share information collected by us “offline” (e.g., by postal mail, contest submissions, telephone requests, surveys, or auto shows). This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected using in-vehicle technologies and related services, including online and mobile services that connect or collect information in association with your Kia vehicle (e.g., MyUvo.com and UVO eServices, which are governed by a different privacy policy, available at https://www.myuvo.com/legal/privacy-policy.shtml). In the Privacy Policy, we refer to our online and offline activities collectively as the "Services".</p>
<p>To the extent we provide you notice on our Services of different or additional privacy policies or practices (e.g., at the point of our collection), those additional terms shall govern such data collection and use.</p>
<p>In addition, please review the Services’ Terms of Service, which governs your use of the Services. By using our Services, you consent to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service and our collection, use and sharing of your information and data, and other activities, as described below.</p>

<h2>1. Who We Are?</h2>
<p>Kia is a subsidiary of Kia Motors Corporation, which is based in Seoul, South Korea. We are the exclusive distributor of Kia-branded motor vehicles, parts, and accessories in the United States. Our “dealers” and “licensees” are independent companies that sell our vehicles, parts, and accessories, and are licensed to operate such businesses using the trade names, trademarks, and service marks owned by us or our affiliates. Our “business partners” are independent companies that we contract with to provide you with or offer you other services and products. In this Privacy Policy, we refer to dealers, licensees, and business partners collectively as “Partners.” This Privacy Policy governs only Kia’s privacy practices. It does not govern the privacy practices of our Partners, even when you connect to their websites from the Services and when their websites or communications are co-branded with Kia trademarks. To learn about the privacy practices of our Partners, please review the privacy policies of each of those Partners. However, if a Partner shares information with us (including when you purchase a vehicle from a dealer and when your Kia vehicle is serviced by a dealer), this Privacy Policy will apply to our collection and use of such shared information.</p>
<p>Our “Affiliates” include our parent company(ies), subsidiaries, sister companies, and affiliated companies. As described below, we may share information that we collect with our Affiliates. Our Affiliates may have their own privacy policies that govern their treatment of information that you provide to them directly or that they collect when you use their websites, applications, or other services. For example, Kia customers who have financed or leased a Kia vehicle through Kia Motors Finance will be subject to Kia Motors Finance’s own privacy policy (and terms of use) with respect to the information collected via Kia Motors Finance’s websites, applications, and other services.</p>
<h2>2. What Information Do the Services Collect?</h2>
<h2>(a) Information You Provide to Us</h2>
<p>Personal Information and Demographic Information. When you engage with us via the Services, we may ask you to provide us with information that could reasonably identify you (“Personal Information”), including your name, phone number, e-mail address, date of birth, username and password, and physical address. You may also choose to send us Personal Information when you submit photos, messages, and other content via the Services. We may also collect information about you that does not on its own reasonably identify you, such as your age range, your profession, your interests, and your language preferences (“Demographic Information”). We may collect Personal Information and Demographic Information in various ways, including via account registration forms, via contact forms, and when you interact with us.</p>
<h2>(b) Information We Collect Automatically</h2>
<p>In addition to the information that you provide to us, we and our third-party service providers may use technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information when you engage online with the Services (“Usage Information”). This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device (a “Device”) whenever you visit or interact with our Services. Usage Information may include, but is not limited to, the following information:</p>
<p>Your Device functionality (including browser, operating system, hardware, mobile network information);</p>
<p>The type of Device you use to access the Services;</p>
<p>The content you view immediately before and after you access the Services;</p>
<p>The online service, if any, that referred you to our Services;</p>
<p>The areas of our Services that you visit and your activities there, including remembering you and your preferences;</p>
<p>The time and duration of your engagement with the Services;</p>
<p>Your IP address, UDID and other unique identifiers (“Device Identifier”). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Service, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier;</p>
<p>How often you visit the online Services; and</p>
<p>Your Device location (as discussed more fully below).</p>
<p>Although Usage Information may not identify you or be associated with you, whenever we associate Usage Information with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.</p>
<p>Some of the methods that we and third parties may use to collect Usage Information include, without limitation, the following:</p>
<p>Cookies. A cookie is a data file placed on your Device when you access the Services. A Flash cookie is a data file placed via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. We may use Cookies and Flash Cookies for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences, and learning how you interact with our online Services. If you choose to disable cookies or Flash cookies on your device, some features of the Services may not function properly.</p>
<p>Web Beacons. Small graphic images or other web programming code called “web beacons” (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web and mobile pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web or mobile page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count users of the Services, to learn how users interact with the Services, to let us know whether you viewed our emails or other electronic communications, and to learn whether our ads are effective.</p>
<p>Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is code that helps us collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on.</p>
<p>Browser Fingerprinting. Collection and analysis of information from your Device, such as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts and other data, for purposes of identification.</p>
<p>ETag, or entity tag. A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.</p>
<p>Recognition Technologies. Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user).</p>
<h2>(c) Precise Location Information</h2>
<p>Our mobile applications and websites may collect precise information about the location of your device after you permit us to obtain such information from your device via GPS, Wi-Fi signals, or cell tower signals. To opt out of the collection of location information from your mobile device, you can adjust the permissions on your mobile device or uninstall our mobile applications.</p>
<p>We collect precise location information to provide you with information that you request, such as the location of a nearby dealer. We may also use and share precise location for any of the purposes described in the “How Do We Use the Information Collected” and “How and When Do We Disclose Information to Third Parties” sections of this Privacy Policy. We will not, however, share your precise location information with unaffiliated third parties for their own use without your consent.</p>
<h2>(d) Information Third Parties Provide About You</h2>
<p>We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect with information that we receive from third parties, including our Partners and Affiliates. We may do so in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to learn about your interests, and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We may combine the information we receive from those sources with information we collect through the Services. When we do so, we will treat the combined the information as described in this Privacy Policy unless we have disclosed otherwise.</p>
<h2>(e) Information You Provide About Others</h2>
<p>If you use the Services to send someone else a communication, such as sending an invitation to a friend, we will use the information you provide (e.g., names and e-mail addresses) to facilitate the communication and not for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly disclose otherwise. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality through our Services, your e-mail address may be included in the communication you send.</p>
<h2>3. How Do We Use the Information Collected?</h2>

<h2>4. How and When Do We Disclose Information to Third Parties?</h2>
<p>We may share information, including Personal Information, Demographic Information, and Usage Information, with our Affiliates and our Partners for their use for internal, administrative, marketing, and other reasons. We may share your Device Identifiers with third parties along with data related to you and your activities. Additionally, we may share information that does not reasonably identify you, such as aggregated user statistics, with any third party for any reason. We do not share Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties (i.e., third parties who are not our Partners or Affiliates) for their own use except where you consent to such sharing or the sharing is necessary to comply with your request for information or services. We may share information we have collected, including Personal Information, as disclosed at the time you provide your information and as described below or otherwise in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>(a) When You Agree To Receive Information from Third Parties.</h2>
<p>You may have the opportunity to receive information or marketing offers directly from unaffiliated third parties. If you agree to receive the communications, your Personal Information will be disclosed to those third parties and all information you disclose will be subject to their privacy policies and practices. We are not responsible for those privacy policies and practices. You should review the privacy policies and practices of such third parties prior to agreeing to receive such information from them. If you later decide that you no longer want to receive communications from a third party, you will need to contact that third party directly.</p>
<h2>(b) Third Parties Providing Services on Our or Your Behalf.</h2>
<p>We may use third-party vendors to perform certain services on behalf of us or the Services, such as: (i) to assist us in Services operations; (ii) to manage a database of customer information; (iii) hosting the Services; (iv) designing and/or operating the Services’ features; (v) tracking the Services’ activities and analytics; (vi) enabling us to send you special offers or perform other administrative services; and (vii) other services designed to assist us in maximizing our business potential. We may provide these vendors with access to user information, including Device Identifiers and Personal Information, to carry out the services they are performing for you or for us. Third-party analytics and other service providers may set and access their own tracking technologies on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, potentially including Personal Information, about you. We are not responsible for those third party technologies or activities arising out of them. However, some may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available in Section 5 below. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of or compliance with any third parties’ opt-out options.</p>
<h2>(c) Co-Branded Services.</h2>
<p>We may provide some aspects of the Services in association with third parties (“Co-Branded Services”) such as Partners, Affiliates, sponsors, charities, and political organizations. Co-Branded Services will identify the third party. These third parties may require you to disclose information to them. If you elect to register for products or services through Co-Branded Services, you may be providing your information to both us and the third party. Any information provided to the third party, including usernames and passwords, is subject to that third party’s privacy policies.</p>
<h2>(d) Sweepstakes, Contests, and Promotions.</h2>
<p>We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (each, a “Promotion”) through the Services that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements such as allowing the sponsor of the Promotion to use your name, voice, or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion’s official rules.</p>
<h2>(e) Administrative and Legal Reasons.</h2>
<p>We may access, use, preserve, transfer and disclose information (including Personal Information):</p>
<p>To satisfy any applicable law, regulation, subpoenas, governmental requests, or legal process if in our good faith opinion such is required or permitted by law;</p>
<p>To protect or defend any terms of use, terms & conditions, or similar provisions or policies applicable to the Services, including investigating potential violations;</p>
<p>To protect the safety, rights, property, or security of us, you, or others; and</p>
<p>To detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.</p>
<h2>(f) Affiliates and Business Transfer.</h2>

We reserve the right to disclose and transfer the information we collect: (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner, or operator of the Services or associated databases; or (ii) in connection with the negotiation, planning, or completion of a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, sale of substantially all of our shares or assets, or other corporate change.</p>
<h2>5. Information About Targeted Advertising and California/Delaware Do Not Track Disclosures</h2>
<p>We contract with third-party advertising networks, publishers, and other entities to advertise our products and services on websites not affiliated with us. Some of these third parties may use cookies or other technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services in order to deliver advertising based on your interests and preferences, as inferred from your browsing histories. This type of targeted advertising is sometimes called “online behavioral advertising.” We follow the industry privacy standards for this type of online advertising. When you see one of our ads on another website that is generated and delivered as part of an online behavioral advertising campaign, you should see a small symbol (also called an icon) attached to the targeted ad that you can click on to learn about why and how you are receiving that particular ad.</p>
<p>We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as a DoubleClick cookie) together to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Services. Google’s use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads based on your visit to our Services and/or other sites and online services. To learn more about how to opt out of Google’s use of first-party cookies, click here. To learn more about how to opt out of DoubleClick’s use of cookies, visit the DoubleClick opt-out page, here.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Services may use Adobe’s Marketing Cloud. See http://www.adobe.com/privacy/marketing-cloud.html for more information. To learn about opting out of the use of Adobe cookies for analytics, visit http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html. After you opt out of the use of Adobe cookies, Adobe will no longer collect and analyze information via cookies associated with your browser for these services. When you opt out, Adobe will place opt-out cookies on your browser. If you delete your cookies, change browsers, or change devices, you will need to repeat this opt-out process. Also, please note that this opt-out process will work only if your browser is set to accept all cookies. We may still use Adobe services to create promotions and apps within social networks after you opt out. These services do not rely on collecting and analyzing information via cookies. To learn more about your choices for these services, review the options your social network provides. Also, we are not responsible for the effectiveness of or compliance with any third parties’ opt-out options.</p>
<p>We may use third-party advertising companies to target advertisements to you on our Services, across the web, on your mobile Device and on any of your other Devices, based on the information we have collected from and about you, as well as information relating to your and other users’ visits to this and other websites and online services. To do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser (including through the use of pixel tags) or recognize an identifier associated with your mobile device. These companies may also use these technologies, along with personal information they or we collect on the different devices you use, to recognize you across the Devices you use, such as a mobile device and a laptop or other computer. If you are in the United States and would like more information about cookies and targeted advertisements or to opt out of having this information used by companies that participate in the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising on desktop and mobile web browsers, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices. You may download the AppChoices app at www.aboutads.info/appchoices to opt out in mobile apps. You may also click on the informational icon contained within each interest based ad. Please note that if you opt out of targeted advertising, you may still receive online advertising from Kia and others while you are browsing online. However, the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests. You should also know that the online behavioral advertising opt-out relies on the use of cookies. If you delete cookies from your Device, buy a new Device, access our Services from a different Device, login under a different screen name, or change web browsers, you will need to register your opt-out preferences again.</p>
<p>Various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice regarding the collection of information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services (e.g., browser do not track signals). Because a “Do Not Track” protocol has not yet been finalized, the information collection and disclosure practices of our websites, and the choices that our websites provide to consumers, will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy, whether or not a Do Not Track signal is received. Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms.</p>
<h2>6. What About Information You Share Publicly?</h2>
<p>Some features of the Services may permit you to submit or post ideas, photographs, user profiles, writings, music, video, audio recordings, computer graphics, pictures, data, questions, comments, suggestions, or other content, including Personal Information (collectively, “User Content”). We or others may reproduce, publish, distribute, or otherwise use User Content online or offline in any current or future media or format. Others may have access to this User Content and may have the ability to share it with other third parties. Please note that Kia does not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public, and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it secure. So, please think carefully before sharing User Content, particularly if it includes Personal Information.</p>
<h2>7. Do the Services Contain Third Party Content and Links to Third Party Services?</h2>
<p>The Services may contain content that is supplied by third parties, including our Partners. Those third parties may collect information about your use of the Services, and they may be able to track your online activities over time and across various websites. In addition, when you are using the Services, you may be directed to other sites or applications that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control. We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by any of these third parties. For example, if you “click” on a banner advertisement, the “click” may take you away from the Services onto a different website. These other websites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data, or solicit Personal Information. They may have their own published privacy statements. We encourage you to note when you leave our Services and to read the privacy statements of all third party websites or applications before submitting any Personal Information to third parties.</p>
<h2>8. How Do You Contact Us or Update or Inquire About Your Information and Communications Preferences?</h2>
<p>You may be able to review the Personal Information that you provided to us. You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your contact information provided as part of registration. If you ask us to stop using the Personal Information you have provided to us, we will honor that request while retaining information as necessary to comply with applicable laws.</p>
<p>For questions about this Privacy Policy, to inquire about reviewing or correcting your Personal Information, or to update your communications preferences, please call our Consumer Affairs Department at 1-800-333-4542 at any time. We will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>
<h2>9. Where Does Kia Process the Information?</h2>
<p>The Services are operated from the United States and intended for users located in the United States. If you are located anywhere outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect, including, Personal Information, will be transferred to, processed in, and stored in the United States. The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those of the country in which you are located, and your Personal Information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States according to laws of the United States. By using the Services or providing us with any information, you consent to this transfer, processing and storage of your information in the United States.</p>
<h2>10. What About Children's Information?</h2>
<p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children younger than the age of thirteen (13). We will delete any Personal Information collected that we later determine to be from a user younger than the age of thirteen (13). If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of thirteen (13) and believe he or she has disclosed Personal Information to us, please contact us at 1-800-333-4542.</p>
<h2>11. What About Security?</h2>
<p>We incorporate commercially reasonable safeguards to help protect and secure your Personal Information. However, no data transmission over the Internet, wireless transmission, or electronic storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that we cannot ensure the security of any information that we collect, and you use our Services and provide us with your information at your own risk.</p>
<h2>12. What About Social Media Features and Widgets?</h2>
<p>Some of our websites and mobile applications may include social media plug-ins (such as the Facebook Like button), widgets (such as the “Share” button), or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites or mobile applications. In addition, some of our websites and mobile applications may also permit or require you to register or log into your account via a social networking platform such as Facebook Login.</p>
<p>These social media features and plug-ins may share with us your username and password for the social media services and other information available on these social media services, in accordance with the terms and conditions (e.g., terms of use and privacy policy) of the company providing those services. In addition, the companies providing these features and plug-ins may be able to collect information about you, including your IP address and your activity on our websites and mobile applications. Social media platforms may notify your connections on their respective platforms about your use of our websites and mobile applications. These social media services may also set cookies to provide their services or use technologies to monitor your online activities over time and across multiple websites and mobile applications for various purposes, including to deliver targeted advertising to you. Your interactions with these plug-in and features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.</p>
<h2>13. What About Changes to the Privacy Policy?</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the updated Privacy Policy, or such later date as may be specified in the updated Privacy Policy. Under certain circumstances (for example, in connection with certain material changes, including changes to our online behavioral advertising data collection use policies and practices), we may also elect to notify you of changes or updates to our Privacy Policy, such as posting a notice on the home page of our website or via a link or tab on the mobile applications. Therefore, you should review this Privacy Policy from time to time, and before using any of our Services.</p>
<h2>14. Your California Privacy Rights</h2>
<p>We may from time to time elect to share certain personal information about you collected by us on the Services with Affiliates and Partners for those parties’ direct marketing purposes. California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents who have supplied personal information, as defined in the statute, to us to, under certain circumstances, to request and obtain certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If this applies, you may obtain the categories of personal information shared and the names and addresses of all third parties that received personal information for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in 2017 will receive information about 2016 sharing activities). To make such a request, please provide sufficient information for us to determine if this applies to you, attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. You may make this request in writing to the Consumer Affairs Department: P.O. Box 52410, Irvine CA 92619-2410.</p>
