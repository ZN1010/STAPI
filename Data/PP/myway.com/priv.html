				<hr>
				<div class="para">At Mindspark, we respect your privacy, and we 
understand the importance of the information you entrust to us. This 
Privacy Policy describes the  practices concerning the information 
collected by the Mindspark family of companies consisting of Mindspark 
Interactive  Network, Inc. and IAC Search and Media Europe Limited  
("Mindspark", "we", "us" and "our") through the use of the (i) websites 
and applications, e.g. tool bars, content, products, forums and 
services, including the "MyWay" email services, controlled by Mindspark 
Interactive Network, Inc.  (the "MS Products") and (ii) our "Search 
Applications" made available by means of a search box on a MS Product or
 website from which you can access our search services. These Search 
Applications are controlled by Mindspark Interactive Network, Inc. for 
users in the United States and Asia Pacific region and by our Irish 
affiliate, IAC Search and Media Europe Limited, for users outside of the
 United States and the Asia Pacific region. Collectively, we refer to 
the MS Products and these Search Applications in this Privacy Policy as 
the "MS Services".</div>
				<div class="para">Mindspark respects the privacy of users of the MS 
Services, and has developed this privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") 
to demonstrate our commitment to protecting your privacy. This Privacy 
Policy is intended to describe for you, as an individual who is a user 
of the MS Services, the information we collect, how that information may
 be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices about such uses 
and disclosures. </div>

				<div class="para bold">A. Search services</div>
				<div class="para">The Search Applications provide features to 
facilitate Internet search and communication services using the MS 
Products including through the MyWay and MyWebSearch portals and email. 
 This search functionality may be implemented through browser settings 
and "extensions" that set or default your browser homepage, start page, 
new tab page and/or default search setting(s), depending on which MS 
Product you are using and what options you select.  We may provide you a
 way to decline or opt-out of the setting(s) change by unchecking the 
appropriate checkbox during the download and installation process for 
the relevant MS Product that provides access to the Search Applications.
  Certain MS Products, such as Chrome new tab products, may be available
 through the online store operated by the browser developer (e.g., the 
Chrome web store) and the user disclosures and options may vary based on
 the store’s requirements. The search features, as well as other 
non-search-related features, may be customized by you.  In addition, you
 may be able to disable or remove the default search features by 
removing or disabling the applicable files you downloaded from the MS 
Products, or changing your default search within your browser, depending
 on your browser, browser version, and tools and features provided in 
your respective browser. Click here to go to <a target="_blank" href="http://support.mindspark.com/ics/support/kbanswer.asp?deptID=30031&amp;task=knowledge&amp;questionID=1552">our support page</a>.</div>
				<div class="para bold">In some MS Products the Search Applications 
are provided by Ask under the Ask brand in which case the relevant Ask 
Privacy Policy applies. This is available <a href="http://about.uk.ask.com/about/terms_conditions/privacy.html" target="_blank">here</a> for European residents and users outside of the United States and the Asia Pacific Region, and <a href="http://about.ask.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">here</a> for users in the United States and the Asia Pacific Region. </div>

				<div class="para bold">B. Information we collect</div>
				<div class="para">We may collect information from you that may 
identify you, such as your name, address, email address, and telephone 
number and anonymous Information, such as the number of your page views,

cannot reasonably be identified from it.</div>


				<div class="para bold">C. How we collect information</div>
				<div class="para">We use various technologies to collect information from your device and about your activities on the MS Services:
					<ol>
						<li><span class="bold">Information You Provide To Us.</span> We 
may collect and store any information you provide when using the MS 
Services (e.g. when registering on the MyWay Site) or that you provide 
in some other manner.  This information may include your name, email 
address, telephone number, username and password or information provided
 when you log-in to the MS Services via Facebook or any other social 
media site (you should review the privacy policy of Facebook or any 
other social media site through which you choose to log into certain MS 
Services). We also collect and store information and other content you 
post to the MS Services, where such features are made available (e.g., 
MyScrapNook). When we provide you with an email inbox as part of an MS 
Product, we may monitor and collect the contents of such emails in the 
course of normal maintenance of the relevant MS Product and its systems.
 Further, in order to permit us to protect the quality of our products 
and services, we may to the extent permitted by applicable law access 
your account and records on a case by case basis to investigate 
complaints or other allegations.</li>
						<li><span class="bold">Automatically Captured Information.</span> 
We automatically collect information from your computer and/or device 
when you use the MS Services. This information may include your IP 
address, your browser type and language and other browser-related 
information, a time-stamp, the keyword query, search query text, search 
results clicked, pages viewed, search history, the content of any of our
 undeleted cookies, including a unique identifier (see <a href="#cookies">section D</a>
 on "Cookies" below), software installed upon and/or devices connected 
to your computer and/or device, and the referring website address.</li>
						<li><span class="bold">Other Technologies.</span> We may use 
standard Internet technology, such as web beacons, cookies and other 
similar technologies, to track your use of the MS Services (see our 
cookies policy). Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded 
in images on the pages of sites. The information we obtain in this 
manner enables us to customize the services we offer as part of the MS 
Services for our users. </li>
						<li>
							<p class="bold">Information Collected By Third-Parties And Behavioral Advertising.</p>
							<p><span class="bold">On The MS Services:</span> We may allow 
third-parties, including our authorized service providers, IAC 
affiliates, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display 
advertisements or place ad tags or beacons on or via MS Services. These 
companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect 
information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. 
(To learn more about cookies generally, please go to our <a target="_blank" href="http://eula.mindspark.com/cookies/">Cookies policy</a>.
 This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and 
evaluate its effectiveness. We may also use information collected by 
these third-parties to better understand our own users, their interests,
 how they use our products, improve and customize our products, and to 
deliver ads targeted to you (either on our MS Services or on other 
websites whether or not owned and operated by us). Please note, some of 
these third-party advertising companies may be members of the Network 
Advertising Initiative, or the Digital Advertising Alliance, each of 
which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member 
companies. For more information about limiting third-party advertising 
cookies, please visit the following links: <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank">aboutads.info</a>, <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/" target="_blank">youronlinechoices.com</a>, or <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">networkadvertising.org</a>.</p>
							<a name="tsa"></a><p><span class="bold">On Third Party Sites, Services And Applications.</span>
 Mindspark and its affiliates work with various companies, such as 
advertisers, ad networks and data management platforms, that may help us
 and other companies to tailor online ads, including through behavioral 
advertising designed to target users’ interests and deliver more 
relevant advertising.  To provide such ads, these third parties may 
collect and/or we may disclose to these third parties a unique ID that 
may be associated with your device’s platform or a device/internet 
browser combination, or they may tell us based on their own data, if 
that unique ID is associated with a particular segment (such as a 
reality show watcher falling within a certain demographic (e.g. female 
aged 30 – 40)). </p>
							<p>We or these third parties may collect the following information (and similar information):</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Demographic data collected on MS Services (e.g., age, zip or
 postal code, gender) and geographic location derived from your IP 
address on your visits to, and collected on, the MS Services and 
non-affiliated websites and applications;</li>
								<li>Data about your use of or visits to the MS Services and non-affiliated websites and applications; </li>
								<li>Data on your interaction with the advertisement displayed on third party websites and applications; and </li>
								<li>Interest and usage data (such as the pages you view and links you click on) acquired from other companies.  </li>
								<li>We may disclose any or all of the collected information to third parties. </li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							<p>We or these third parties may use the collected information to
 provide advertisements of interest to you on certain MS Services and 
non-affiliated websites and applications and for other purposes 
described in this privacy policy (such as to improve or customize our 
products). Three companies we currently work with to target our own ads 
on other websites based on activity on the MS Services are AppNexus, 
Adobe and Exelate. If you tell us not to send you these types of ads by 
opting out (as described <a href="#cookies">below</a>), you may still 
see our ads on other companies’ websites, but they will not be 
specifically tailored to you based on your activity on our MS Services. </p>
							<p>To learn about – and if you would like to, opt-out of targeted
 advertising from  -- various types of ad networks that we may work 
with, and who are involved in serving online behavioral advertising, 
please go to www.aboutads.info/choices, www.networkadvertising.org 
and/or www.youronlinechoices.com  and opt-out of online behavioral 
advertising. </p>
						</li>
						<li>Please note that you cannot opt-out of ads on mobile apps via 
the site listed above.  However, your mobile devices may offer settings 
that enable users to limit how mobile device ad tracking occurs, using 
unique device identifiers such as the Apple IDFA and Google Android 
Advertising ID.  Some information about those settings may be reviewed 
for Apple <a target="_blank" href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4228">here</a> and for Android <a target="_blank" href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en">here</a>. </li>
						<li><span class="bold">Do not track signals.</span>  MS Services 
systems are not configured to respond to Web browser "do not track" 
signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to 
exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable 
information about an individual consumer's online activities over time 
and across third-party Web sites or online services.</li>

local stored objects) to collect and store information when you interact
 with the MS Services, such as when you use our web and search tools and
 extensions, view our emails or view our ads.  We, and certain third 
parties we work with e.g. ad networks and data management platforms, may
 also use these technologies  to better target ads to you based on your 
online browsing activities.
