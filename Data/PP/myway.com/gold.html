<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<div>Last Updated: March 28, 2017</div>
<p>At Mindspark, we respect your privacy, and we understand the importance of the information you entrust to us. This Privacy Policy describes the practices concerning the information collected by the Mindspark family of companies consisting of Mindspark Interactive Network, Inc. and IAC Search and Media Europe Limited ("Mindspark", "we", "us" and "our") through the use of the (i) websites and applications, e.g. tool bars, content, products, forums and services, including the "MyWay" email services, controlled by Mindspark Interactive Network, Inc. (the "MS Products") and (ii) our "Search Applications" made available by means of a search box on a MS Product or website from which you can access our search services. These Search Applications are controlled by Mindspark Interactive Network, Inc. for users in the United States and Asia Pacific region and by our Irish affiliate, IAC Search and Media Europe Limited, for users outside of the United States and the Asia Pacific region. Collectively, we refer to the MS Products and these Search Applications in this Privacy Policy as the "MS Services".</p>
<p>Mindspark respects the privacy of users of the MS Services, and has developed this privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") to demonstrate our commitment to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy is intended to describe for you, as an individual who is a user of the MS Services, the information we collect, how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices about such uses and disclosures.</p>
<p>Please Note: Your installation and use of a Mindspark Browser described in Annex 1, is subject to this Privacy Policy along with the Supplemental License and Privacy Terms Pertaining to Mindspark Browser set forth in Annex 1. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for information on how to contact us. Unless indicated otherwise MS Services are subject to our Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy, and for downloadable software (where applicable) the End User License Agreement; Certain MS Services may be subject to different privacy policies and/or terms of service as indicated on the sites from where those services are available and/ or accessed.</p>
<h2>A. Search services</h2>
<p>The Search Applications provide features to facilitate Internet search and communication services using the MS Products including through the MyWay and MyWebSearch portals and email. This search functionality may be implemented through browser settings and "extensions" that set or default your browser homepage, start page, new tab page and/or default search setting(s), depending on which MS Product you are using and what options you select. We may provide you a way to decline or opt-out of the setting(s) change by unchecking the appropriate checkbox during the download and installation process for the relevant MS Product that provides access to the Search Applications. Certain MS Products, such as Chrome new tab products, may be available through the online store operated by the browser developer (e.g., the Chrome web store) and the user disclosures and options may vary based on the store’s requirements. The search features, as well as other non-search-related features, may be customized by you. In addition, you may be able to disable or remove the default search features by removing or disabling the applicable files you downloaded from the MS Products, or changing your default search within your browser, depending on your browser, browser version, and tools and features provided in your respective browser. Click here to go to our support page.</p>
<p>In some MS Products the Search Applications are provided by Ask under the Ask brand in which case the relevant Ask Privacy Policy applies. This is available here for European residents and users outside of the United States and the Asia Pacific Region, and here for users in the United States and the Asia Pacific Region.</p>
<h2>B. Information we collect</h2>
<p>We may collect information from you that may identify you, such as your name, address, email address, and telephone number and anonymous Information, such as the number of your page views, link clicks, and login times. Your information may be kept in an identifiable format, or in an aggregate format which means that you cannot reasonably be identified from it.</p>
<h2>C. How we collect information</h2>
<p>We use various technologies to collect information from your device and about your activities on the MS Services:</p>
<p>Information You Provide To Us. We may collect and store any information you provide when using the MS Services (e.g. when registering on the MyWay Site) or that you provide in some other manner. This information may include your name, email address, telephone number, username and password or information provided when you log-in to the MS Services via Facebook or any other social media site (you should review the privacy policy of Facebook or any other social media site through which you choose to log into certain MS Services). We also collect and store information and other content you post to the MS Services, where such features are made available (e.g., MyScrapNook). When we provide you with an email inbox as part of an MS Product, we may monitor and collect the contents of such emails in the course of normal maintenance of the relevant MS Product and its systems. Further, in order to permit us to protect the quality of our products and services, we may to the extent permitted by applicable law access your account and records on a case by case basis to investigate complaints or other allegations.</p>
<p>Automatically Captured Information. We automatically collect information from your computer and/or device when you use the MS Services. This information may include your IP address, your browser type and language and other browser-related information, a time-stamp, the keyword query, search query text, search results clicked, pages viewed, search history, the content of any of our undeleted cookies, including a unique identifier (see section D on "Cookies" below), software installed upon and/or devices connected to your computer and/or device, and the referring website address.</p>
<p>Other Technologies. We may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons, cookies and other similar technologies, to track your use of the MS Services (see our cookies policy). Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of sites. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer as part of the MS Services for our users.</p>
<h2>Information Collected By Third-Parties And Behavioral Advertising.</h2>
<p>On The MS Services: We may allow third-parties, including our authorized service providers, IAC affiliates, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements or place ad tags or beacons on or via MS Services. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. (To learn more about cookies generally, please go to our Cookies policy. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and evaluate its effectiveness. We may also use information collected by these third-parties to better understand our own users, their interests, how they use our products, improve and customize our products, and to deliver ads targeted to you (either on our MS Services or on other websites whether or not owned and operated by us). Please note, some of these third-party advertising companies may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative, or the Digital Advertising Alliance, each of which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. For more information about limiting third-party advertising cookies, please visit the following links: aboutads.info, youronlinechoices.com, or networkadvertising.org.</p>
<p>On Third Party Sites, Services And Applications. Mindspark and its affiliates work with various companies, such as advertisers, ad networks and data management platforms, that may help us and other companies to tailor online ads, including through behavioral advertising designed to target users’ interests and deliver more relevant advertising. To provide such ads, these third parties may collect and/or we may disclose to these third parties a unique ID that may be associated with your device’s platform or a device/internet browser combination, or they may tell us based on their own data, if that unique ID is associated with a particular segment (such as a reality show watcher falling within a certain demographic (e.g. female aged 30 – 40)).</p>
<p>We or these third parties may collect the following information (and similar information):</p>
<p>Demographic data collected on MS Services (e.g., age, zip or postal code, gender) and geographic location derived from your IP address on your visits to, and collected on, the MS Services and non-affiliated websites and applications;</p>
<p>Data about your use of or visits to the MS Services and non-affiliated websites and applications;</p>
<p>Data on your interaction with the advertisement displayed on third party websites and applications; and</p>
<p>Interest and usage data (such as the pages you view and links you click on) acquired from other companies.</p>
<p>We may disclose any or all of the collected information to third parties.</p>
<p>We or these third parties may use the collected information to provide advertisements of interest to you on certain MS Services and non-affiliated websites and applications and for other purposes described in this privacy policy (such as to improve or customize our products). Three companies we currently work with to target our own ads on other websites based on activity on the MS Services are AppNexus, Adobe and Exelate. If you tell us not to send you these types of ads by opting out (as described below), you may still see our ads on other companies’ websites, but they will not be specifically tailored to you based on your activity on our MS Services.</p>
<p>To learn about – and if you would like to, opt-out of targeted advertising from -- various types of ad networks that we may work with, and who are involved in serving online behavioral advertising, please go to www.aboutads.info/choices, www.networkadvertising.org and/or www.youronlinechoices.com and opt-out of online behavioral advertising.</p>
<p>Please note that you cannot opt-out of ads on mobile apps via the site listed above. However, your mobile devices may offer settings that enable users to limit how mobile device ad tracking occurs, using unique device identifiers such as the Apple IDFA and Google Android Advertising ID. Some information about those settings may be reviewed for Apple here and for Android here.</p>
<p>Do not track signals. MS Services systems are not configured to respond to Web browser "do not track" signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about an individual consumer's online activities over time and across third-party Web sites or online services.</p>
<h2>D. Cookies</h2>
<p>We use cookies and similar technologies (such as local stored objects) to collect and store information when you interact with the MS Services, such as when you use our web and search tools and extensions, view our emails or view our ads. We, and certain third parties we work with e.g. ad networks and data management platforms, may also use these technologies to better target ads to you based on your online browsing activities. Please see our Cookies Policy for further information about our use of these technologies, and please see the above Section titled "On Third Party Sites, Services and Applications" to learn more about how we use information to (and work with others that use information to) provide behavioral targeted advertising.</p>
<p>Major browsers provide users with various options when it comes to cookies. Users can usually set their browsers to block all third-party cookies (which are those set by third-party companies collecting information on websites operated by other companies), block all cookies (including first-party cookies such as the ones Mindspark uses to collect search activity information about its users), or block specific cookies.

<h2>L. Requests To Remove Search Results Pursuant To European Court Of Justice Ruling</h2>
<p>Following a recent ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), users of our European web search and reference services who are EU residents may request that certain results do not appear following a web search for the user’s name.</p>
<p>If you would like to request the removal of a search result generated using your name as the search term, please send your request in writing to IAC Search and Media Europe, Ltd at the address below. To assist us in processing your request in timely manner, please make your request in English if you are able to do so. Your request should include any information relevant to your request, including: (i) your name, email and postal address; (ii) the URL (i.e., "web address") for each link that you are requesting to be removed; (iii) a brief explanation of why you believe such results should be removed; (iv) an explanation of whether or not you fulfil a role in public life; and (v) an explanation as to why the contents of the link you wish to have removed relate to you.</p>
<p>To help us prevent fraudulent removal requests, please also include a legible copy of a document that verifies your identity. You need not provide a government-issued document; a utility bill or similar mailing will suffice. You may also obscure parts of the document such as identifying numbers so long as the document continues to clearly identify you. If you are requesting the removal of search results that contain photographs of you, please ensure that the identifying document includes your photograph. If you are making the request on behalf of another person, please indicate your relationship to that person and provide evidence of your authority to make such request. All requests for removal will be reviewed by IAC Search and Media Europe Limited’s legal and compliance team in Ireland and we reserve the right, in compliance with applicable laws and considering the balance between the user’s right to privacy and the public’s interest in access to information, to accept or reject, or make further inquiries regarding, any requests.</p>

We recommend that you check this page, the help menu within an MS Product, or this url http://support.mindspark.com/, from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies.</p>
<p>We may acquire or develop new MS Products and/or MS Services from time to time that require additional privacy disclosure. In such case, we will add these additional provisions in a product specific annex or section that will only apply to such new MS Product or MS Service and will not vary the terms of this Privacy Policy in relation to your use of existing MS Products and MS Services (and, as such, we will not be required to notify you of such additional terms unless you also use the new MS Products or MS Services).</p>
<h2>P. Your California Privacy Rights</h2>
