<p>If you make a request for information about, subscribe to or make an online purchase of, goods or services offered by one of our business partners on the Site, you are giving us your express permission to share your personal information with that business partner so that your request, subscription, or purchase can be fulfilled under that partner's own online privacy policies and practices.

You may choose to opt-out of our re-target advertising, at least for certain participating companies who are voluntary members of the Digital Advertising Alliance by visiting the DAA website located at www.digitaladvertisingalliance.org. Note that not all of our partners may be participants of the DAA so we encourage you to contact these partners directly through their own web sites to request that you have yourself removed from their targeted ads. We cannot guarantee that your request will be honored by every one of our non-DAA member partners, however.</p>
<h2>Your California Privacy Rights</h2>
<p>If you are a California consumer, upon your request (see Section 8 of this Policy entitled 'Contacting Us Regarding This Policy'), we will disclose to you what personal information of yours was shared with what third party business partners within the immediately preceding calendar year (including disclosing to you our partners' names and addresses) if such information was used by our partners for their marketing purposes.</p>
<h2>Data in the Aggregate</h2>

<h2>Reservation of Rights</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose personal information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, bring or defend against legal action involving someone who may be violating this Policy or who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Amtrak's rights or property, other Amtrak users or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities.

<p>Your User Profile Information and Amtrak Guest Rewards membership account information (should you enroll in the Amtrak Guest Rewards program) are password-protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Also remember to sign out of your Amtrak account and close your browser window or the mobile application when you have finished. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer or mobile device with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.</p>
<p>When you give Amtrak personal information about you, that information may be sent electronically to servers outside and separate from Amtrak and outside of the state where you originally entered the information.

Whenever we handle personal information as described above, regardless of where this occurs, we take steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Amtrak.com, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. However, we cannot accept liability for disclosure of any personal information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized ads or errors and omissions of third parties.</p>
