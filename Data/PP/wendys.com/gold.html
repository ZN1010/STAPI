<h2>Tracking Technologies (Cookies)</h2>
<p>When you visit the Site, we and our business partners may use tracking technologies to enhance your online experience or customize our offerings.</p>
<p>A few additional important things you should know about our use of tracking technologies (cookies):</p>
<p>We offer certain features that are available only through the use of tracking technologies.</p>
<p>We use both session and persistent tracking technologies. Tracking technologies (e.g. cookies) can either be persistent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser). You are always free to decline tracking technologies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of the Site. Refer to the help section of your browser, browser extensions, or installed applications for instructions on blocking, deleting, or disabling tracking technologies such as cookies.</p>
<p>We encode and protect the tracking technologies that Wendy’s sets, so that only Wendy’s and our designated service providers (e.g., our advertising and technology partners) can interpret the information stored in them.</p>
<p>You may encounter tracking technologies/cookies from our third-party service providers that we have allowed on our site that assist us with various aspects of our web site operations and services, such as Google Analytics, as further described above.</p>
<p>You also may encounter tracking technologies from third-parties on certain pages of the websites that we do not control and have not authorized (e.g., if you view a web page created by another user, there may be a cookie placed by that web page).</p>
<p>We may target and track the videos you view on the Site. You consent to our tracking of your video viewing through the Site or third-party social media for up to two years (or as permitted by applicable law) or until you withdraw consent.</p>
<p>For more information about the use of cookies and similar technology on our online services, please review this Privacy Policy and our Cookies and Tracking Technologies Policy. For information about opt out programs that third party advertising companies participate in, and to opt out of the use of website browsing data for interest-based advertising by companies that participate in these programs, click the following:  NAI Opt Out or DAA Opt Out. To opt out of the use of data collected from the mobile applications on your mobile device to serve ads that are targeted to your interests, consult the settings on your device.</p>
<h2>Accessing, Reviewing, and Changing Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>Registered members can review and change personal information at any time by accessing their accounts on the Site. You should promptly update your personal information if it changes or becomes inaccurate. We may retain some information from closed accounts so that we can comply with law, prevent fraud, assist with investigations, resolve disputes, analyze or troubleshoot programs, enforce our Terms of Use, or take other actions permitted by law. We may also retain certain transaction history and other non-personal information to analyze user behavior. Likewise, if your account or membership is terminated or suspended, we may maintain some information to prevent re-registration. Unfortunately, if you close your account, we cannot reactivate it, but you are always welcome to open a new one.</p>
<h2>Notice to California Residents</h2>
<p>Residents of the State of California may request a list of all third-parties to which our online service has disclosed certain personal information (as defined by California law) during the preceding year for those third-parties’ direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and want such a list, please contact us at: Wendy’s International, LLC, One Dave Thomas Boulevard, Dublin, OH 43017, Attn: General Counsel, Legal Department. For all requests, you must put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the body of your request, as well as your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. In the body of your request, please provide enough information for us to determine if this applies to you. You need to attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. Please note that we will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information.</p>
<p>How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals for California Residents. California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how Wendy’s responds to “Do Not Track” browser settings. Wendy’s does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.</p>
<h2>Third Parties</h2>
<p>Our Site may contain links to other third-party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these third-party sites.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We store and process your information on our servers located within and outside of the United States. We protect your personal information using technical and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use include data encryption, firewalls, regular security assessments of IT infrastructure, and access controls to physical, network-based and data assets. While we implement the above security measures on the Site, you should be aware that one hundred percent security is not always possible and, as a result, we cannot guarantee the security of your information. It is your responsibility to make sure that your personal information is accurate and that your passwords and account registration information is secure and not shared with third parties.</p>
<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The Site is a general audience site and it is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information via our websites, applications, services, or tools from users in this age group. If you believe your child has provided personal information to us, please contact us via the email listed in Section 14 below..</p>
<h2>International Transfer</h2>
<p>Many of our computer systems are currently based in the United States. As we operate internationally, your personal information may be processed in the U.S. and elsewhere where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you create an account/profile, you consent to the collection and/or processing in the United States of your personal information and tracking technologies/cookies as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>Notification Regarding Updates</h2>
<p>From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy. You agree that we may notify you about material changes in the way we treat personal information by placing a notice on the Site. You should check the Site frequently for updates. If Wendy’s or any third-party to whom we disclose your personal information is required to provide notice of a security breach, you consent to receiving notice through this Site or via the email address you have provided to us, at our discretion.</p>
