<p>Similarly, the Yahoo Privacy Policy will apply on Yahoo branded sites and affiliated products, services, and technologies that link to the Yahoo Privacy Policy. If there is a conflict between the Oath Privacy Policy and the Verizon or Yahoo privacy policies, the Oath Privacy Policy will apply when you are on an Oath product, service, or brand site that links to this policy and the Yahoo Privacy Policy will apply on Yahoo branded product, service, technology, or sites that link to the Yahoo policy. Additional privacy information is available in the Verizon Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>What's New</h2>
<p>The Oath Privacy Policy was updated effective June 13, 2017.</p>
<p>The AOL company name has changed to Oath. The way we handle your information hasn't changed, so the Oath Privacy Policy will continue to govern when you are on previously branded AOL products, services, or technologies, including AOL Mail, AOL.com, HuffPost, Engadget, TechCrunch, Moviefone, and Makers.</p>
