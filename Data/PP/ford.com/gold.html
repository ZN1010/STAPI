<h2>7. Methods to Collect Information:</h2>
<p>A “cookie” is a small text file that helps us in many ways to make your visit to our website more enjoyable and meaningful to you. For example, cookies avoid you having to log in every time you come back to one of our websites. They also allow us to tailor a website or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences. There are a couple different types of cookies.</p>
<p>A “session” cookie is stored only in your computer’s working memory (RAM) and only lasts for your browsing session. When you close all your browser’s windows, or when you shut down your computer, the session cookie disappears forever.</p>
<p>A “persistent” cookie is stored on your computer’s hard drive until a specified date, which could be tomorrow, next week, or 10 years from now. Persistent cookies stay on your computer until either a) they expire, b) they are overwritten with newer cookies, or c) you manually remove them. Most browsers can be configured not to accept cookies, however, this may prevent you from having access to some site functions or features.</p>
<p>This site may use a third party to activate and/or deliver a service, or deliver site functionality such as fulfilling your request to purchase a product or service, including items from our online store. In performing this function the third party may place a persistent cookie on your computer or have to gather personal information from you in order to activate and deliver the service, or facilitate the processing of your purchase.</p>
<p>This site may use third-party click tracking analytics tools (such as Adobe, DoubleClick, Efficient Frontier, Keynote, Google Analytics and Mouseflow) to capture clickthrough statistics. These parties may collect information about your use of the site and across different sites and mobile apps, and across devices over time.</p>
<p>This site may use spotlight ads/web beacons/GIF/pixel tags which are site instrumentation tools that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times. Emails or electronic newsletters we send may use tools (e.g., pixel tags or web beacons) to gather email metrics and information to improve the reader’s experience such as how many of the emails are opened, if they were printed or forwarded, the type of device (e.g., mobile or PC) from which they were opened, and the city, state, and county associated with the applicable IP address. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a webpage, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon.</p>
<p>This website may generate a “session log” when you visit our site. We use session logs to help us determine how people travel through our site. In this way, we can structure our pages so that the information most frequently visited is easier to find. By tracking page visits, we can also determine if the information we’re providing is being used. The only data gathered is the Internet Protocol (IP) address from which you came, the website that referred you, the pages you visited and the date and time of those visits.</p>
<p>Users may be directed to this site via banner ads, site links or QR Codes. Ads, site links or QR Codes may use tools such as cookies or web beacons to deliver metrics on the effectiveness of the ads or links. They do not collect personally identifiable information from the user.</p>
<p>Users you may be provided the opportunity to integrate with third-party social media sites, and this site may track on an aggregate level the number of items “liked” on this site, or items on this site that you choose to share with a third-party social media site.</p>
<h2>Interest-Based/Online Behavioral Advertising</h2>
<p>Interest-Based Advertising. On some pages of our site we may allow third-party advertising partners to set web tracking tools (e.g., cookies, web beacons) to collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable information regarding your activities on those web pages (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day). We may also share such information we have collected with third-party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and combine it with information collected from other websites, apps or other digital services) for purposes of delivering future targeted advertisements to you when you interact with other (non-Ford) sites, mobile apps or digital services within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as "interest-based advertising".</p>
<p>Pages of our website that collect information that may be used by such advertising partners for interest-based advertising purposes are identified by a link to AdChoices in the footer of the page.</p>
<h2>Opting out</h2>
<p>Note: The process to opt-out of interest-based advertising is different for web browsers and mobile apps.</p>
<p>1. Opting out on website pages. If you do not want your online browsing while on such pages to be used for interest-based advertising purposes, you may click on the AdChoices link in the footer to opt-out of such uses by the listed advertising partner(s). An opt-out applies only to the device and browser in use at the time of opting out. If you clear your browser cookies and wish to remain opted out of interest-based advertising, you must opt-out again. See the following paragraph to learn more about how opting out works. Even if you opt-out through this service, we may still collect non-personally identifiable information regarding your site activities and use it for non-interest-based advertising purposes.</p>
<p>1a. Opt-out Compliance Service for interest-based advertisements. This site and advertisements on third-party sites that link to this privacy statement use the Ghostery assurance service to comply with the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising (now generally known as interest-based advertising) managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) (http://www.aboutads.info). When you opt-out on site pages, or through such advertisements, Ghostery conveys your opt-out election(s) to the applicable advertising partner(s), which then know to place a cookie on your specific computer and browser (and only the specific computer and browser from which you opt-out) indicating that you have opted out. If you clear your browser cookies and wish to remain opted out of interest-based advertising, you must opt-out again. The list of our advertising partners that place cookies on this website may be updated from time to time. To opt-out of internet-based advertising by all DAA-participating companies and to learn more about interest-based advertising, visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.</p>
<p>2.

<p>Android - click here</p>
<p>See the Opting out on website pages section above for opting out of interest-based advertising related to your mobile phone’s browser.</p>
<p>3. Opting out through online advertisements. Advertisements on third-party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this privacy statement may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-personally identifiable information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the advertising partners' use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes. Even if you opt-out through this service, we may still collect and use information from the advertisements for non-interest-based advertising purposes, such as to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements.</p>
<p>4. Opting out of interest-based advertisements on other digital services. Users of other digital services (such as cable and direct TV) may be able to opt-out of interest-based advertising through the provider of the digital service. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of your digital service provider to determine if they engage in interest-based advertising, and, if so, how to opt-out.</p>
