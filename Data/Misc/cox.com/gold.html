<p>CoxCom, LLC and its affiliates and/or distribution partners (collectively "Cox") are pleased that you have chosen Cox® High Speed InternetSM service (the "Service"). Our goal is to provide you and our other subscribers with an enriched, high quality Internet experience. This Acceptable Use Policy (the "AUP") has been designed to protect our Service, our subscribers, and the Internet community from inappropriate, illegal or otherwise objectionable activities.

<p>4. Commercial Use. The Service is designed for personal, non-business related use of the Internet and may not be used for commercial purposes. You may not resell the Service or otherwise make the Service available for use to persons outside your dwelling (for example, through an open wireless home network). You agree not to use the Service for operation as a de facto Internet service provider, or for any other business enterprise (whether for profit or non-profit), including, without limitation, IP address translation or similar facilities intended to provide additional access. For commercial Internet service please contact Cox Business.</p>
<p>5. Servers. You may not operate, or allow others to operate, servers of any type or any other device, equipment, and/or software providing server-like functionality in connection with the Service, unless expressly authorized by Cox.</p>
<p>6. Misuse of Service. You may be held responsible for any misuse of the Service that occurs through your account or IP address, even if the misuse was inadvertent. You must therefore take precautions to ensure that others do not gain unauthorized access to the Service or misuse the Service, including conduct in violation of this AUP.</p>
<p>7. Hacking/Attempted Unauthorized Access. You may not use the Service to breach or attempt to breach the security of another user or attempt to gain access to any organization or person's computer, software, or data without the knowledge and consent of such person. The equipment and the Service may not be used in any attempt to circumvent the user authentication or security of any host, network or account. This includes, but is not limited to, accessing data not intended for you, logging into or making use of a server or account you are not expressly authorized to access, or probing the security of other networks or computers for any reason. Use or distribution of tools for compromising security, such as password guessing programs, cracking tools, packet sniffers or network probing tools, is prohibited.</p>
<p>8. Security. You are solely responsible for the security of any device connected to the Service, including any data stored on that device. You are responsible for implementing appropriate security precautions for all systems connected to the Service to protect against threats such as viruses, spam, Trojan botnets, and other malicious intrusions. You are responsible for enabling the security of any wireless (Wi-Fi) networks connected to the Service. Any wireless network installed by the customer or a Cox representative that is unsecured or "open" and connected to the Cox network is prohibited. You authorize Cox to use technology to detect unsecured wireless networks associated with your use of the Service. If Cox determines that you are using the Service via an unsecured wireless network, Cox will notify you to enable the Security on the Wi-Fi device.</p>
<p>9. Disruption of Service. You may not disrupt the Service in any manner. You shall not interfere with computer networking or telecommunications services to any user, host or network, including, without limitation, denial of service attacks, flooding of a network, overloading a service, improper seizing and abuse of operator privileges or attempts to "crash" a host.</p>
<p>10. Viruses, Trojan Horses, Worms and Denial of Service Attacks. Software or other content downloaded from the Service may contain viruses and it is your sole responsibility to take appropriate precautions to protect your computer from damage to its software, files and data. You are prohibited from posting, transmitting or disseminating any information or software that contains a virus, Trojan horse, spambot, worm or other harmful program or that generates levels of traffic sufficient to impede others' ability to send or retrieve information. Prohibited conduct of this type includes denial of service attacks or similarly disruptive transmissions, as well as transmissions containing other harmful or malicious features. We may suspend the Service without prior notice if we detect a harmful program such as a virus infection. Your service will be resumed once the harmful program is removed.</p>
<p>11. Email. You may not use the Service to send bulk, commercial or unsolicited ("spam") email messages. Any unsolicited email, originating from any source, must not direct recipients to any website that is part of our Service, such as personal web pages, or other resources that are part of the Service. The Service may not be used to collect responses from unsolicited email sent from accounts on other Internet hosts or email services that violate this Policy or the acceptable use policy of any other Internet service provider. In addition, "mail bombing," the sending of numerous copies of the same or substantially similar messages or very large messages or files with the intent to disrupt a server or account, is prohibited.</p>
<p>You may not reference Cox in the header or body of an unsolicited email, or list an IP address that belongs to the Cox network in any unsolicited email. Further, you may not take any action which implies that Cox is the sponsor of any unsolicited email even if that email is not sent through the Cox network. Further, forging, altering or removing electronic mail headers is prohibited.</p>
<p>If the Service is disconnected, whether voluntarily or by termination, all user names and associated electronic email addresses may be immediately released for reuse. Upon disconnection, any mailbox contents may be immediately deleted or held in a locked state. Addresses and email may be held until Cox deletes them as part of its normal policies and procedures. There is no obligation for Cox to retain or make any user name, email address or stored email retrievable once the Service is disconnected.</p>
<p>12. Data Usage, Data Storage and Other Limitations. Cox offers multiple packages of Service with varying speeds, features and data plans (not all packages are available in all areas). You must comply with the current data usage, data storage, email limits and other requirements associated with the package of Service you selected. Information on speeds, usage and other features can be found at Speeds and Data Plans Information. You must ensure that your activities do not improperly restrict, inhibit, or degrade any other user's use of the Service, nor represent (in Cox’s sole judgment) an unusually great burden on the network itself. In addition, you must ensure that your use does not improperly restrict, inhibit, disrupt, degrade or impede Cox's ability to deliver the Service and monitor the Service, backbone, network nodes, and/or other network services. In some rare cases, Cox may suspend or terminate the Service if the issues in question have not been resolved after consultation with Cox.</p>
<p>13. Conflict. In the event of a conflict between the Subscriber Agreement and this AUP, the terms of the Subscriber Agreement will prevail.</p>

<h2>e911 Notification</h2>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission has asked phone service providers to share these important facts about E911:</p>
<p>Enhanced 911 allows emergency personnel to locate you in the event of an emergency. They will not be able to locate you if you move your modem to a new location. Please contact Cox if you need to relocate your telephone modem. It can take up to 2 business days for your new address to be updated. - The telephone modem does not include a backup battery but can support one if you wish to have home telephone service during a power outage for access to Enhanced 911 and other calling. Please contact Cox at 855-324-7700 or visit a Cox store to obtain a compatible battery. If you purchase a battery, or receive a battery as an eligible Lifeline customer, you are responsible for installing, monitoring battery health and contacting Cox when it needs to be replaced. - Telephone service, including access to e911 service will not be available during a power outage if the telephone modem does not have a battery or if the modem is moved or inoperable.</p>
<h2>Telecommunications Relay Services (711)</h2>
<p>The FCC requires all telecommunications companies provide customers who subscribe to telephone service with toll-free, three digit dialing access to Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS). TRS is a service available to all Cox Digital Telephone customers to facilitate telephone conversations with individuals who may have hearing or speech disabilities through TRS operators, called communications assistants (CAs).</p>
<p>A TRS call may be initiated by either a person with a hearing or speech disability, or a person without such disability. When a person with a hearing or speech disability initiates a TRS call, the person uses a teletypewriter (TTY) or other text input device to call the TRS relay center, and provides the CA with the telephone number of the party that he or she would like to call. The CA then places an outbound voice call to that number. The CA then serves as a link for the call, relaying the text of the calling party in voice to the called party, and converting to text what the called party voices back to the calling party. There is no cost to the TRS user.</p>
<p>Customers can conveniently dial 711 to reach a communications assistant at the TRS center 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. All calls are confidential. For more information about TRS, see the FCC’s consumer fact sheet at https://www.fcc.gov/guides/telecommunications-relay-service-trs.</p>
<h2>Important Information About the Use of Your Cox Digital Telephone Service During a Power Outage</h2>
<p>We would like to make you aware of important information on the backup battery that is needed to maintain your home phone service during power outages.  If a backup battery for your Cox telephone equipment was not installed with your service, you may order backup batteries from Cox by calling (855) 324-7700 or visiting a Cox retail store.  The cost for an 8-hour battery from Cox currently is $29.99.  If you have a home alarm system, medical monitoring devices or other similar equipment that utilizes your telephone line to operate, you may need separate power supplies to operate those devices during a power outage in addition to backup batteries for each Cox telephone device located in your home.  If you have any questions about this information or need our assistance, please contact Cox Customer Support or review the information at www.cox.com/battery.</p>
<p>Read the Telephone Modem Battery Policy en espanol &gt;</p>
<h2>How to Maintain Telephone Service During a Power Outage</h2>
<p>An Embedded Media Terminal Adaptor (also called a “telephone modem”) has been installed to provide Cox Digital Telephone service within your home.  Some customers whose homes are served directly by fiber optics may also have other Cox phone equipment at their home in addition to the telephone modem.  The telephone modem and other Cox telephone equipment work on household power, but you may purchase a backup battery for each device to ensure continued service during a power outage.  The backup battery for the Cox telephone modem provides up to 8 hours of standby service or up to approximately 4 hours of talk time using a corded phone connected directly to the telephone modem’s jack.  Please note that cordless phones require a power source separate from the backup battery for the telephone modem.  Cox recommends that you keep a corded phone for use during any electrical power outage and that during such outages you keep non-emergency calls to a minimum to prolong the life of any battery needed for the operation of Cox’s telephone equipment.  If the power outage lasts beyond the capability of the batteries being use, you will not be able to place or receive calls (including 911) until power is restored.  To avoid the loss of telephone service during prolonged outages, Cox recommends that you consider purchasing reserve backup batteries and rotate the batteries you have to help retain their charge.</p>
<h2>It Is Your Responsibility to Purchase and Monitor the Battery and Order a Replacement</h2>
<p>You are responsible for purchasing a battery for each telephone modem and any other Cox telephone equipment being used and for ordering replacement batteries when necessary.  YOU ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THE BATTERIES CONNECTED TO THE COX TELEPHONE EQUIPMENT BEING USED IN YOUR HOME, AND CONTACTING COX WHEN BATTERIES NEED TO BE REPLACED.</p>
<p>Your telephone modem has a battery indicator light on the front of the device, which displays the status of the battery.</p>
<p>The following table provides the status of your telephone modem battery.</p>
<p>Please visit www.cox.com/battery for more information on how to monitor the health of the batteries used for your telephone modem and other Cox equipment and to purchase any replacement batteries when needed.  You may also contact Cox Customer Support for more information on monitoring procedures or on purchasing backup power for your telephone service.</p>
<p>Under normal operating conditions, most batteries will not need to be replaced for several years; however, factors such as age and temperature could impact battery performance. Therefore, Cox recommends that you check your battery on a regular basis.  Similar to your fire alarm, you might consider checking your telephone modem battery at least twice a year. To protect the environment, Cox supports battery recycling and encourages you to consult www.cox.com/battery for instructions on recycling your used backup batteries.</p>
<h2>Lifeline Customers</h2>
<p>Lifeline customers may either have backup batteries installed with their service or receive free batteries by mail when their application for Lifeline is processed and they are determined to be eligible.  If you purchase a battery before you are deemed eligible for Lifeline you will receive a bill credit for the cost of the battery after your eligibility is established.  Lifeline customers are responsible for monitoring the health of any battery being used as discussed on this page, but will not be charged when they order replacement batteries.  Backup batteries for other Cox telephone equipment may not be available for self-installation.</p>
<h2>Other Information on Installing and Maintaining Your Service and Battery Installation</h2>
<p>Your phone modem needs to be placed near a cable outlet in order to connect to Cox’s network.  Please discuss any special needs you have with the Field Service Representative installing your service.  If you are installing services through our self-install process, please ensure that you place your telephone modem near a cable wall outlet and electrical outlet.  If you have any questions about telephone modem placement, please contact Cox Customer Support. If you do not feel comfortable installing your own battery, please call us to make an appointment; please note, however, that there may be a charge for this service.</p>
<h2>Additional Battery Information</h2>
<p>The Cox battery is warranted for one year. If the battery fails within one year, subject to manufacturers limitations, contact Cox by calling (855) 324-7700 or visiting a Cox retail store for a replacement.  The battery offered by Cox is designed to fit directly into your specific telephone modem and may not be available at retail stores.  Even if your telephone modem does not have multiple battery slots, you should consider purchasing additional backup batteries and rotate them to retain their charge.</p>
<p>If you are interested in obtaining an alternative power source for your Cox telephone modem or other Cox telephone equipment in use, or other electronics that may need to be used during an extended power outage, please contact your local electronics or battery retailer for other possible options for an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) capable of supporting 120 VAC.  Such backup power devices may cost in excess of $100.00.  Cox cannot guarantee that batteries purchased from sources other than Cox will be compatible with the telephone modem or other telephone equipment provided by Cox.</p>
<p>The batteries for the Cox telephone modem and other Cox telephone equipment cannot provide power to any external communications devices that require electricity.  This means that during a power outage, cordless phones and adaptive telecommunications devices used by disabled customers (which require electricity) may not be available for use.  If you have a cordless phone for your daily use, Cox encourages you to keep a corded phone available for use during a power outage. For adaptive devices, please consult the manufacturer for options.</p>
<p>It is important to keep the batteries connected to the telephone modem and other Cox telephone equipment, if any, in order for the batteries to remain charged.  Removal of the battery from its proper place will cause it to lose its charge and you may be unable to place or receive calls during a power outage, including 911 calls.  If you store a backup battery, we recommend that you store it in a room where the temperature is generally above 41°F and below 90°F.  The telephone modem should be plugged directly into an electrical outlet and not connected to a power strip or an electrical outlet controlled by a wall switch.  If you do remove the battery from the telephone equipment being used, please make sure you remove and replace it carefully and avoid bending the pins in the equipment’s battery bay.  If you bend the pins, the equipment, especially the telephone modem, may not work properly or consistently on battery power during a power outage.  If this occurs, you must contact Cox to request new telephone equipment.  If we find that your telephone equipment or batteries have been damaged through improper use, Cox may assess a charge to replace the equipment.</p>
<h2>Important Liability Information</h2>
<p>The telephone modem and any other equipment installed by Cox require power to operate properly. You have the obligation, among other things, to ensure that the telephone equipment being used is connected to electrical power at all times, that you have sufficient backup power supplies for electrical power outages, and that you regularly monitor the equipment’s batteries’ health.  Except for potential service or billing credits that depend in part on the cause and severity of the service disruption, Cox is not liable to you if you experience an interruption of service due to power outages, including failure due to the absence or insufficiency of battery backup power or an outage affecting the Cox network.</p>
<p>If Cox is found to be grossly negligent in its installation or disconnection of your service, Cox will be liable for any direct damages to property or persons that result from such gross negligence. Under no circumstance will Cox be liable for punitive or consequential damages or lost profits.</p>

<h2>Homelife Terms of Service</h2>
<h2>Homelife Equipment</h2>
<p>All equipment added to your Cox Homelife system is subject to the terms and conditions of your subscriber agreement, including applicable limitations and warranties.</p>
<h2>Continuous Video Recording (CVR)</h2>
<p>Additional equipment is required at a $0 lease. Customer does not acquire ownership in devices, and must be returned upon termination of service, subject to non-return fees.</p>
