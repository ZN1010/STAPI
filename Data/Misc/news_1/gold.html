<p>KKR needs to grab wickets in the PowerPlay to get an upper hand against CSK</p>
<p>Batsmen may dominate the scene when Kolkata Knight Riders hosts table topper Chennai Super Kings at the Eden Gardens here on Thursday.</p>
<p>Both sides were engaged in a high-scoring thriller when CSK played the host about three weeks ago. The experienced CSK batsmen flexed their muscles to overhaul a tough target of 203.</p>
<p>CSK has crossed the 200-mark four times and has recorded a lowest total of 169 to underline its authority with the bat this season and ensure 12 points from six wins.</p>
<h2>Good contributions</h2>
<p>The consistent Ambati Rayudu, an in-form M.S. Dhoni, the accomplished Shane Watson and the reliable Suresh Raina have scored in excess of 200 runs individually to propel CSK’s heavy duty performances. Dwayne Bravo and Sam Billings have also lent support.</p>
<p>“The big guys still have a lot to give. The calmness around the group plays a big part,” says CSK coach Stephen Fleming, stressing the importance of having seasoned performers in the team.</p>
<p>KKR, which has scored less than 160 just once, has amassed double hundred aggregates twice to show that it is capable of putting up big totals. Some fine chases have enabled the fourth-placed host to pick up eight points.</p>
<p>Flamboyant opener Chris Lynn, captain Dinesh Karthik and the dependable Andre Russell, who has also made significant contributions with his medium pace bowling, have gathered more than 200 runs apiece, apart from Robin Uthappa (who has collected 199), to serve KKR well.</p>
<p>It has also benefited from crucial knocks of Nitish Rana and all-rounder Sunil Narine. However, Rana’s lower back issue may be a cause of concern for the host.</p>
<p>In bowling, CSK manages to check the opposition. Experienced hands such as Bravo, Watson, Harbhajan Singh, Imran Tahir, Ravindra Jadeja and youngsters including Shardul Thakur, K.M. Asif and Lungi Ngidi provide flexibility.</p>
<h2>Variety in bowling</h2>
<p>KKR’s bowling unit has got variety — including spinners Narine, Kuldeep Yadav and Piyush Chawla, who hold the key, and a mix of pacers in Russell, Tom Curran, the seasoned Mitchell Johnson and under-19 World Cup-winning sensation Shivam Mavi. They need to grab wickets in PowerPlay overs to give the team an upper hand.</p>
<p>The Eden Gardens, where the home side has registered some big scores, may get divided between the loyalists of KKR and MSD.</p>
