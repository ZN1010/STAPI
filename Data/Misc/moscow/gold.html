<h2>8 Things to Do in Moscow Idaho</h2>
<h2>8 Things to Do in Moscow Idaho</h2>
<p>Moscow Idaho is located about 8 miles from Pullman, Washington (home of Washington State University) and home to one of the best colleges in Idaho, University of Idaho. I’m a bit bias because I went to school here, but if you ever make it to Idaho it’s worth a quick trip! You’ll find it easy to get to if you’re in Northern Idaho or close to Coeur d’Alene or Sandpoint.  The rolling hills of the Palouse surrounding Moscow are breathtaking and the college campus, which makes up the majority of the town, is Idaho’s oldest school. The campus itself is charming with brick buildings covered in ivy, large lawns and massive fraternity and sorority houses.</p>

<p>The town itself is granola/hippie in nature (different from other parts of Idaho) and has a wonderful farmer’s market, great breweries, cute shops and fun art festivals all year round. It’s a great place to walk around and explore for a day or two in the summer or while school is in session!</p>
<h2>Here are some of my absolute favorite things to do in Moscow Idaho when I visit.</h2>
<h2>1. Greek row.</h2>
<p>Greek row reminds me of the sororities from the movies with all of the well-manicured lawns and huge houses all on the same street. I have some great memories in this house right thurrr.</p>
<h2>2. Hello Walk.</h2>
<p>This path is super famous with University of Idaho students as it’s one of the main walkways on campus. It runs from Greek Row to the Administration Building and you can’t miss it! The large trees and steps leading up to the admin building are beautiful in all seasons. This path was coined,  “Hello Walk”,  because you see everyone you know walking up and down it.</p>
<h2>3. Mikey’s Gyros.</h2>
<p>Mikey’s is divey, dark, and has some of the best gyros and hummus I’ve ever had. Make sure to stop here for a cheap lunch and $1 PBR’s. Who can resist that?</p>
<h2>4. The Corner Club.</h2>
<p>MY FAVORITE BAR. It’s won a few awards for best college bar and historic bar. It’s literally a square gray box and with tubs of beer for $3. HOLLA.</p>
<h2>5. The Arboretum.</h2>
<p>Technically there are two arboretum’s (we call it The Arb). One old and one new. One is more of a forest on campus and the other is an amazing park with hidden lakes, trees, benches, views and turtles.</p>
<h2>6. The Bagel Shop.</h2>
<p>At the Bagel Shop, you can get any kind of bagel sandwich you can think of. My fave is the Sweaty Teddy. They even steam the bagels. What more can you ask for at breakfast, lunch or 2 am?</p>
<h2>7. Moscow Farmer’s Market.</h2>
<p>Moscow is located close to a lot of farms which makes this farmer’s market pretty robust. It’s got all kinds of great locally made/grown items like homemade bread, veggies, flowers, milk, beer, jewelry…you name it! Visit on a weekend and fill up your basket with cheap and fresh goodies.</p>
<h2>8. Local Tap Houses/Breweries.</h2>
<p>Lately, Moscow has become a hot spot for great places to drink beer. Check out Rants & Rave’s Brewery, Tapped, Hunga Dunga, & Ale House to grab a beer with friends and chill out!</p>
<h2>9. BONUS! Moscow Mountain.</h2>
<p>Head up to Moscow Mountain if you want to hike a bit or get some mountain biking in on the many biking trails!</p>
<div>If you’re ever in Northern Idaho, I highly recommend visiting this cute little college town! And I hope this post gives you a sense of things to do in Moscow Idaho!</div>
