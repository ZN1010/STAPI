<h2>Cookie Policy</h2>
<div>Effective: September 26, 2017</div>
<p>A browser cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on your device to help websites and mobile apps remember things about you. Other technologies, including Web storage and identifiers associated with your device, may be used for similar purposes. In this policy, we say “cookies” to discuss all of these technologies.</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use information from and about you when you use Snapchat and certain other Snap Inc. services. This policy explains more about how we use cookies and your related choices.</p>
<h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>
<p>Like most providers of online services, Snap Inc. uses cookies for a number of reasons, like protecting your Snapchat data and account, helping us see which features are most popular, counting visitors to a page, improving our users’ experience, keeping our services secure, and just generally providing you with a better, more intuitive, and satisfying experience. The cookies we use generally fall into one of the following categories.</p>
<h2>Your Choices</h2>
<p>Your browser or device may allow you to block or otherwise limit the use of cookies. But cookies are an important part of how our services work, so removing, rejecting, or limiting the use of them could affect the availability and functionality of our services.</p>
<h2>Browser Cookies</h2>
<p>Your browser may provide you with the option to refuse some or all browser cookies. You may also be able to remove cookies from your browser. For more information about how to manage browser cookies, please follow the instructions provided by your browser.</p>
<h2>Mobile Device Identifiers</h2>
<p>Your mobile operating system may let you opt-out from having certain device identifiers used for interest-based advertising. You should refer to the instructions provided by your mobile device’s manufacturer; this information is typically available under the “settings” function of your mobile device.</p>
<p>And of course, if your mobile device offers an uninstall process, you can always stop us from collecting information through the app by uninstalling the Snapchat app.</p>
