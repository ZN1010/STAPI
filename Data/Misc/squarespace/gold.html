<h2>COOKIE POLICY</h2>
<div>Last updated: September 26, 2016</div>
<p>This Cookie Policy describes how Squarespace uses cookies and similar technologies to provide, improve, promote and protect the Services. Note that any capitalized terms not defined in this Cookie Policy have the meanings set forth in our Terms of Service. If you have any comments or questions about this Cookie Policy, feel free to contact us at privacy@squarespace.com.</p>
<p>Cookies. Cookies are small pieces of text sent to your browser when you visit a site. They serve a variety of functions, like enabling us to remember certain information you provide to us as you navigate between pages on the Services. We use cookies for the following purposes:</p>
<p>Authentication, Personalization And Security. Cookies help us verify your Account and device and determine when you’re logged in, so we can make it easier for you to access the Services and provide the appropriate experiences and features. We also use cookies to help prevent fraudulent use of login credentials.</p>
<p>Performance And Analytics. Cookies help us analyze how the Services are being accessed and used, and enable us to track performance of the Services. For example, we use cookies to determine if you viewed a page or opened an email. This helps us provide you with information that you find interesting. We also use cookies to provide insights regarding your End Users and Your Sites’ performance, such as page views, conversion rates, device information, visitor IP addresses and referral sites.</p>
<p>Third Parties. Third Party Services may use cookies to help you sign into their services from our Services. We also may use third party cookies, such as Google Analytics, to assist with analyzing performance. Any third party cookie usage is governed by the privacy policy of the third party placing the cookie.</p>
<p>Squarespace Ads. We partner with third party publishers, advertising networks and service providers to manage our ads on other sites. Our third party partners may set cookies on your device or browser to gather information about your activities on the Services and other sites you visit, in order to provide you with Squarespace ads. For example, if you visit Squarespace and also use a social media platform, you may see a Squarespace ad in your social media newsfeed or timeline.</p>
<p>Opting Out. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services. We currently don’t respond to DNT:1 signals from browsers visiting our Services. You can also opt out of receiving interest-based ads from certain ad networks here (or if located in the European Union, here).</p>
<p>Pixels. A pixel tag, or pixel, is a small piece of code that can be embedded on websites and emails. We use pixels to learn how you interact with our site pages and emails, and this information helps us and our ad partners provide you with a more tailored experience. For example, if you visit a Squarespace page related to music, a pixel will help us show you an ad for that page when you later visit a music news site.</p>
<p>Device Identifiers. We use device identifiers to track, analyze and improve the performance of the Services and our ads.</p>
<p>We may modify this Cookie Policy from time to time, and will post the most current version on our site. If a modification meaningfully reduces your rights, we'll notify you in accordance with the procedures set forth in our Terms of Service.</p>
