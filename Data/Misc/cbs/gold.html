<h2>MANAGING COOKIES</h2>
<p>Whether cookies are placed on your computer or mobile device is something you can control. This section describes how you can manage the cookies that are placed on your computer or mobile device by CBS Interactive and third parties.</p>
<h2>MANAGING THIRD PARTIES' BEHAVIORALLY TARGETED ADVERTISING ON YOUR COMPUTER</h2>
<p>A number of the companies that use cookies to collect information about your online activities using web-based advertising are members of the Network Advertising Initiative("NAI"). The NAI offers a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads from member companies. To opt out of information collection by NAI member companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please visit the NAI consumer opt out page. Also, through the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of and greater control over ads that are customized based on their online behavior across different websites. To learn more and make choices about interest-based ads from participating third parties, please visit the DAA consumer opt out page, European DAA online choice page and Australian DAA online choice page.</p>
<p>If you opt out of having your information used to deliver advertisements tailored to your interests, you will continue to see advertisements on our Services, but these advertisements may not be as relevant to you.</p>
<h2>ADJUSTING YOUR BROWSER SETTINGS</h2>
<p>You have the option to set your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, notify you when a cookie is set, and delete cookies periodically (including third party behaviorally targeted advertising cookies). Each browser is different, so please refer to the guide below, which describes how to set the cookie options on a number of different browser types.
