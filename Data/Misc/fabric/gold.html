<h2>7 RULES FOR CHOOSING PERFECT CURTAINS</h2>
<div>StoneGable</div>
<div>|</div>
<div>39 Comments</div>
<p>Recently, my master bedroom got BEAUTIFUL new curtains. And I realized there is a whole lot that goes into choosing curtains for a room. Curtains, although they mostly play a supportive role in the beauty and comfort of our homes, have a role to play. There are so so many options for adorning our windows. So today we will talk about 10 rules for choosing perfect curtains.</p>
<p>Today on Decorating Tips And Tricks we are talking about Transitioning From Spring To Summer Decor. You will get lots of great ideas tips to help make decorating more creative and easy!</p>
<div>Listen to episode #192 BELOW…</div>
<p>Let’s look at some simple things to do that add up to perfect curtains for the rooms in your home!</p>
<h2>THINK ABOUT USE</h2>
<p>We need to be realistic about how we use the curtains in our home.</p>
<p>Are your curtains going to block out light or your neighbor’s trash cans? Do you like the way curtains filter light into a room? Are they only to add lots of beauty and interest to a room? Are your curtains close to a door or any traffic patterns in your home? Will you pair curtains with blinds or shades? These are just some of the questions to ask yourself before buying any curtains.</p>
<p>Although most of us want to get to the fun decisions like style and fabrics we need to do our homework and think about how we will use curtains we choose! We want the curtains in our homes to be fabulous AND functional!</p>
<h2>STYLE</h2>
<p>There are soooooo many styles of curtains literally a click of the computer away, right? Do you like floor length curtains? Full curtains? Tab curtains? Pinch pleats? Are you going for a formal look or a casual one? Are your curtains playing a supportive role in a room or are they a stand-out focal point?</p>
<p>Think about how a pair of curtains will work with the rest of the room. This is a good starting point when thinking about the style we should choose.</p>
<p>Ask yourself these things…</p>
<p>will the curtains enhance the style of the entire room</p>
<p>will they make the room look bigger (yes they can)</p>
<p>will the curtains make too little of a difference</p>
<p>will the curtains make too much of a statement</p>
<p>will my eyes be drawn to the curtains</p>
<p>will they be a nice backdrop for the rest of the furnishings</p>
<h2>FABRIC/MATERIAL</h2>
<p>I adore fabric! Even when it comes to choosing the right curtains for my home choosing the right fabric can be a bit harrowing! Here at StoneGable curtains are considered a supporting role in a room so I keep them very subtle. And I like curtains to frame my windows. Nothing too flouncy. So I stay pretty neutral in color and tailored in style.</p>
<p>How about you? If you like your curtains to show up and get noticed then go for it! Just make sure they work with the colors and motifs in the other fabrics in your room.</p>
<p>Do you like sheer fabrics? Heavy fabrics, brocades, burlap, linen, cotton, and on and on. Do yourself a favor, and get plenty of samples before you take the plunge! There are probably lots of fabric options that would work in any room!</p>
<p>If you like fuller curtains make each panel three times the width of the window they will adorn. If you like a more casual look make each panel two times the width.</p>
<p>The sheer curtains above were an easy-peasy diy project. If you like them you can make them too. Click HERE to see how I made them.</p>
<h2>HARDWARE</h2>
<p>Hardware can be much of an afterthought when we are talking about curtains. But it shouldn’t be at all! What holds curtains on the wall is important.</p>
<p>Ask yourself what color/finish do you want curtain hardware to be? What kind of rod do you want to use? What will hold the curtains on the rod? Do you want to make a statement with the curtain rods or let them go as unnoticed as possible? How far from the wall do you want the curtains to be hung? Do you want custom made curtain rods? Will you use finials or have rounded corner rods that hug the wall?</p>
<p>Another thing to be aware of is how long the curtain rods need to be for the window and the wall space you have on either side of the window for your curtains to hang.</p>
<p>The answer to these questions will determine what curtain rod will work best for you and what the price point of the rods will be.</p>
<h2>HEIGHT/LENGTH</h2>
<p>The length of a curtain depends on the kind of curtains you choose.</p>
<p>Here are a few guidelines…</p>
<p>short curtains should be hemmed to so they just skim the windowsill</p>
<p>long curtains can brush the floor, break the floor (have a small bend in them at the hem), or pool on the floor a couple inches or more.</p>
<p>Make sure you know the exact curtain length you will need. Measure the window and wall area for the curtains before buying!!!!!</p>
<p>Curtains that are hung high make a room look taller and more elegant.</p>
<p>My best advice is to hang curtains as high as you can and as long as you can make them. “Hang em’ high and swing em’ low!”</p>
<h2>HANGING CURTAINS</h2>
<p>Throw out everything else you have read about how to hang curtains. Here’s the best tip. Place curtains for one window on a rod and manually put them where you want them to go. Make sure the curtains follow the guidelines above for height and length. When they are perfect for you mark the spot to hang your rods. Use these measurements for any other curtains in the same room as long as the windows are the same size.</p>
<p>Really, you never know exactly how the curtains will look until you hang that first one. Make sure it is perfect!!!!!</p>
<h2>CARE</h2>
<p>In years past there was an adage to never wash curtains but let them rot on the windows. YUCK!!!! Seriously!!! Yes, those were the days of heavy drapes and lots of embellishing windows. Those days are long gone. Now if you know how to care for your curtains you can clean them yourself or have them professionally cleaned and looking as good as new!</p>
<p>Save any cleaning instructions! Vaccum curtain regularly and while you are at it also vacuum your window sills and molding.  Wash your curtains when they get dirty.</p>
<p>Curtains get grimy and attract grease and dust and more so you might want to think of giving them a good washing every 6 months or so.</p>
<p>I can’t wait to share the curtains chosen for the master bedroom. You can see the plans HERE for now and look for the master bedroom reveal coming in late May!</p>
<p>Now, you can choose those curtains you’ve had your eye on with confidence. Or you might want to take a look at the curtains you already have and rethink them!</p>
<p>Do you have a tip for choosing the perfect curtains? We’d love you to share!</p>

<div>This topic gives me great anxiety! I didn’t buy enough drapes for the family room, go back and they are all gone.. nothing, zero, zip! So now I will need to find a whole new pattern but buy more of them to make the window look better.</div>
<div>Gwen commented</div>

<div>Vicki commented</div>
<div>I love the beige and white curtains and the wall color! Can you tell me the brand of the curtains and what the wall color is?</div>
<div>StoneGable commented</div>
<div>Hi Vicki, I made and lined the curtains. The fabric came from Ethan Allen. You can find all about the wall colors of StoneGable here:http://www.stonegableblog.com/reasons-love-stonegable-color-palette/</div>

<div>I can’t wait to see your master bedroom!!! I, too, am also looking for drapes for my master. Thank you for the great tips!</div>
<div>REBECCA commented</div>
<div>I started actually following your blog a few months ago although I had checked in on it periodically before that.</div>
<div>I want to say that I really appreciate all the information about all things “decor” that you provide on your blog.</div>
<div>So thank you,</div>
<div>Rebecca</div>
<div>StoneGable commented</div>
<div>You are so welcome Rebecca. Thank you for letting me know that it is useful!</div>
<div>SUSAN D. commented</div>
<div>I really admire the woven wood shades that you have used in some of the window posts. Do you have a source for them?</div>
<div>StoneGable commented</div>
<div>Yes, they were very reasonably priced. I got them at Lowes. They are the cut-to-your-size blinds.</div>
<div>Joanna commented</div>
<div>I’ve been trying to find ready made curtains for my guest room and master. Any that I like are only 84” and that is too short. Where do you find yours or do you make them?</div>
<div>StoneGable commented</div>
<div>I like Pottery Barn, Ballard Design, Soft Surroundings, Wayfair etc! I also make them myself.</div>
<div>Connie Fowler commented</div>
<div>I bought some at Pottery Barn a few years ago that were longer–90-ish inches. I don’t recall the exact measurements.</div>
<div>Joanna commented</div>
<div>Thank you Connie. I’ll check out their website. The closest one is about four hours away, so online is a blessing,</div>
<div>Bunny commented</div>
<div>I am anxiously awaiting your master bedroom reveal!!!</div>
<div>Happy Friday!</div>
<div>Carole commented</div>
<div>Love your posts. (I’m a new subscriber.) When I bought curtains for our new dining room I knew that I wanted something light and sheer (I love the sun streaming in), that I wanted grommet tops, and I just wanted to frame the window on either side (we have venetian blinds) and I wanted them to come all the way to the floor. After spending way too much time online I actually ended up ordering curtains from Target. They were inexpensive but they were also perfect for the room. They compliment but do not dominate the decor and most important they make me happy every time I look at them.</div>
<div>StoneGable commented</div>
<div>I love finding the “right” decor elements for a room! Kudos to you!</div>
<div>Darlene commented</div>
<div>Great info and suggestions.</div>
<div>Thank you for sharing!</div>
<div>Sindy commented</div>
<div>Love the smocked curtains! can you please tell me where to purchase those?</div>
<div>StoneGable commented</div>
<div>I found these at Decor Steals. Not sure if they have them anymore.</div>
<div>Christy commented</div>
<div>I would like to know where you purchased your living room drapes. They would fit perfectly in my living room. I look forward each morning to reading your blog. It is so inspirational, especially for an aging woman who loses contact with what is in style. I don’t want my home to grow old and dreary. Thanks again for all of your ideas and encouragement to try new and different things.</div>
<div>StoneGable commented</div>
<div>Hi Christy, I made them and lined them myself. The material came from Ethan Allen. Hope this helps.</div>

<div>What a timely post. Thank you, Yvonne, you’ve great information on a practical topic we all have to make choices on. Im in a bit of a dilemma, and I’m wondering if you can help? I have a bank of South facing windows in my dining room…two windows that flank a large picture window. The span is 14′ wide, and my ceiling is coffered and 12′. I have creamy linen curtains I love to hang at least 9′ or higher before the coffered starts. My dilemma is what curtain rod to use. Goodness, that is a far span of 14′! Should I use three rods? Have my husband make a “pipe rod,” though my decor is European farmhouse and that might look a bit too industrial? The rod can’t be too small of a diameter with the weight of the curtains and scale of the room (stone fireplace). My second question is, I think I need to put something behind them….sheer or shade…to allow filtered light to flow in, but not beat on the wood floor and furniture, and to not have to open and close the curtains all day. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I’ll have to keep the inner layer down in cost as the linen curtains were a splurge. Thanks for any help on this! It’s so wonderful to bounce around decor dilemma ideas with others, especially, when I’m sitting here with my cup of tea wondering what to do!</div>
<div>StoneGable commented</div>
<div>Okay, let’s start with the first question. If your husband can make a pipe rod you could always paint it. What a great solution! If you use one rod and I suggest you do, make sure it is bracketed to your wall at least in the middle. No drooping rods, please!</div>
<div>I’d paint it the color of my walls if you want the rod to “disappear”.</div>
<div>I love filtered light and would certainly use a shade that can be used to filter or block light. They usually retract into the upper casing of the window and look lovely.</div>
<div>I think sheers, even though lovely, would look dated and would block any view! There are some amazing shades. I am getting some from Next Day Blinds that I love! Hope this helps.</div>
<div>JC commented</div>
<div>Thank you, Yvonne. We’ll have to play around with the rod idea and how we will do the end caps etc. I too definitely think one rod is the way to go. I’m blessed to be married to a “Mr. fix it- can build anything guy” so I’m sure he will engineer something. I was leaning towards the blind idea, so thank you for the tip on Next Day blinds. I’ll check them out! Can’t wait to see your master bedroom! Did I miss the bathroom you were doing last year?</div>
<div>Doreen commented</div>
<div>Years ago I found linen look drapes with a bit of embroidery at Target of all places.They are light, airy and wash beautifully I have them in my bedrooms and living room on rods with rings.Love yours with the smocking on top.</div>
<div>Carole commented</div>
<div>I ended up ordering curtains from Target as well. After looking at dozens of stores and websites, they had the exact ones that I wanted and they look great.</div>
<div>Pinky commented</div>
<div>Can’t wait to see your master. I haven’t gotten up that way yet but will SOON, I promise. Can’t wait to see you, I miss you! Have a great weekend my friend!!!!</div>
<div>Dee Geis commented</div>
<div>I love you posts! Thank you! You have wonderful ideas</div>
<div>Kathleen Kral commented</div>
<div>Great tips. As a window treatment designer, I just have one correction. Short curtains should hang 4” (hem size) below the sill. You should not see the hem from the outside or in the glass area. The exception would be privacy sheers which could have a bottom rod or a smaller hem.</div>
<div>Also linings and interlining need to be considered as they effect drape and light control.</div>
<div>Thanks for letting everyone know that there is a lot to consider.</div>
<div>StoneGable commented</div>
<div>You are right Kathleen. I love the 4 inch drop. But they can skim the sill too! Thanks for the great tips</div>
<div>DebRN commented</div>
<div>Selecting new curtains for the living room is one of my spring projects. In the winter I love my burgundy drapes but they are way too heavy in warmer months. I am thinking something in soft yellow. Do you have favorites sources? Thank you for not thinking this is too little a topic!</div>
<div>StoneGable commented</div>
<div>Lots of comment saying Target is a great place for curtains. I also love Pottery Barn and Ballard Designs.</div>
<div>Kathy M. commented</div>
<div>Finally but the bullet and switched over our master bedroom being to a new lite weight comforter and thinking about some new curtains. Temperature when I woke up was 34 degrees! Spring oh spring wherefore art tho?? I guess we just have to be patient. Thanks for the tips on curtains. Maybe I will just go shopping for some today because I won’t be working in the garden.</div>

<div>Thanks for all the info on curtains, very informative. I really like the curtains you show in your livingroom, they are white/cream background with beige design on them. Did you make those or purchase them?</div>
<div>StoneGable commented</div>
<div>I made them Pam with fabric from Ethan Allen.</div>
<div>Carol J commented</div>
<div>When I was growing up there were summer and winter curtains in our home. They got laundered and ironed and put away for the next season. I still prescribe to that with my sheers. The heavier curtains get taken down and put in the dryer with a dry cleaning cloth to be fluffed at that time for a nice clean look to the windows.</div>
<div>Karen commented</div>
